[REDACTED], liebe [MANUALL_REDACTED],
ZÃ¤hlen wir eigentlich auch Bachelorarbeits-Projekte? [REDACTED] unten.

Betreff: Interests on the new degree program: AI in society
[REDACTED]. [MANUALL_REDACTED],
my name is [REDACTED], and I am studying informatics B.Sc. at TU Munich. Recently I noticed that School of [REDACTED] and Technology is offering a new study program, AI in society. While I took a look at the admission requirements, it says a practical project of at least 18 ECTS was required.
Since the bachelor program of TUM Informatik only offers thesis of 15 credits, does this mean I will not be qualified, even if the content of the thesis project is qualified for the application?
Best,
[REDACTED]
