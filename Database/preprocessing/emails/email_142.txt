[REDACTED],
I have just now calculated your results. I will enter the official points and decision in the system today, but I will let you know informally via email since it is urgent for you:
Unfortunately, your candidacy has led to a rejection. I am sorry to tell you this news, but unfortunately the points you scored in the test and from your degree grades do not pass our thresholds.
I can see that you are very motivated, but unfortunately there is nothing I can do here, since we must stick to the guidelines, so that the decisions are fair for everyone.
Thank you for going through the application process with us, and your patience. I wish you the very best for your future.
Best wishes,
[REDACTED]
