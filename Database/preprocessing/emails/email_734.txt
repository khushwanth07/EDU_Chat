Body:
Dear applicant,
thank you for your interest in the M.Sc. AI in Society.
We are currently preparing a form that lets you enter the information about your practical project in an organized matter. There we also explain how to calculate whether your project's credits correspond to at least 18 ECTS credits. I would kindly ask you to wait around a week or two until this form (and other forms) appear inside the application process -- they should make your application easier.
In this form however, you will need to provide the module description of this project. In this case, maybe you could reach back out to the instructor of this module and ask for an official module description.
Unfortunately, we cannot count projects that do not incorporate some sort of social science perspective. However, you are very welcome to include them in the (optional) motivational letter. For more information on the motivational letter, please see here.
Please don't hesitate to reach back out if you have further questions.

[REDACTED],
I am very very sorry my previous e-mail subject,
I am a double degree student in [REDACTED] University, Physics 
Engineering and [REDACTED] BSc subjects.
I want to apply AI in Society MSc. program but i have a question about 
practical project.
On application requirements page, "Requirement: Practical project" 
description mentioned that "you should have successfully completed a 
practical project, usually comprising at least 18 credits," how can i 
prove my project has 18 ECTS? My project details and paper is it 
enough or do I need to document this from my own school? Because 
although my project courses appear on my transcript, there is no 
document regarding the content of the project in my university's system.
I have also projects apart from the projects that are mentioned, like 
AI and [REDACTED] -This projects not included social analysis 
etc.-. Is this projects could be a [REDACTED]?
