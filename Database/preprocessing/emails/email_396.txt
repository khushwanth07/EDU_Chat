[REDACTED]. [MANUALLY REDACTED],
I apologize for the short notice, but I would like to know if it is possible to reschedule the aptitude test for July 17th. I have a conflicting appointment tomorrow, which coincides with the originally scheduled test. If rescheduling is not feasible, I will still attend the test tomorrow. However, it would be greatly appreciated if I could take it on the 17th instead.
Thank you very much for your understanding!
