Body:
Exactly. You do not need an APS certification, at least I have not heard about it nor have I seen other applicants submit it. But the VPD: yes.

TUM does not specifically ask for APS approved documents for your application. Therefore, I suppose it is good to have, but not actually a requirement. We also donâ€™t state so on any of our websites.
What we do state however, is the VPD, which also checks your university documents.
Therefore, I cannot give you any comments about the APS, as we do not ask for it.
