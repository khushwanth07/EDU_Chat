The letter should state that I will be allowed to attend/join late for classes physically and till then I can participate in online classes.
Thank you for your support and cooperation.

It is not a problem if you arrive in person to Munich in December and participate online until then. In fact, several people have a similar situation as you, so this is ok.
We can issue a letter stating that German knowledge is not required for our program. However, what exactly should be stated in the letter of extension?
Best,

Hello,
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your assistance with my visa application.
Application number:- [PHONE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]Applicant number:- [PHONE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]MTK [PHONE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]As my visa appointment is scheduled for October 28 and my program starts on October 15, I kindly request an extension letter or any supporting documentation to accommodate the timelines. Given the estimated 30-day processing period for the visa, would it be acceptable for me to begin attending classes in person from the first week of December while participating in online sessions via Moddle until then?
Furthermore, I will require a letter confirming the exemption from the German language requirement for my program, which is essential for my visa submission.
To summarize, I kindly request:
  1.  An extension letter or supporting document for the visa application.
  2.  A letter confirming the exemption from the German language requirement for my program.
These documents are required to complete my visa application, and I would greatly appreciate your prompt assistance.
Thank you for your support and cooperation.
