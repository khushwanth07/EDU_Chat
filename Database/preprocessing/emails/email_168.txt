I have even contacted the School of social sciences and technology. and they suggested that the AI in Society program can help me([REDACTED]@sot.tum.d[IMAGE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]ailto:[REDACTED]@sot.tum.de>).
I am requesting a letter from AIS verifying my English language proficiency for the AI in Society program.I know it's verified during the admission process but if you can provide me with a document on TUM letterhead it would be very helpful for my visa procedure.

No actually , lettershould be like the M.Sc AI in Society department had looked at my application and confirmed that I as an applicant have enough english skills to enroll for the master program.
Even this matter written on TUM letterhead with anyoneâ€™s signature from dept will work.

They most probably mean that you need to get it from the department you actually received your degree from. We cannot issue you a verification of English language proficiency, as you have not studied with us.
Best wishes

I hope this email finds you well.
I am writing to request a letter from the university verifying my English language proficiency. [REDACTED] in India requires this document for my visa application, as my IELTS score is 1 year old. ( even though validity for IELTS is 2 years)
I would like to highlight that the proficiency requirement for the Master's program is 6.5 bands (B2 CEFR), and I have scored 8 bands (C1 CEFR). Also my entire bachelors was done in english. In addition, I can also show more than 15 ECTS credits worth of bachelor's thesis and papers written entirely in English.
I have contacted  [REDACTED]@tum.d[IMAGE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]ailto:[REDACTED]@tum.de>  they said I have to get it from the department. Can you provide it ?
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
