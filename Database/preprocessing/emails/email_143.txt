Yes you could send me the document also what kind of document that i should prepare for enrollment? It was said that there are several documents that I need to send to the TUM office with notarized documents. I need to prepare it first and wait for the visa to be issued first to accept the offer.
Thank you

To answer your questions:
  *   You can find the academic calendar on our website: https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/. The lecture periods you can find here, under “semester structure -> Winter semester 2024/25”: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/application/application-info-portal/dates-periods-and-deadlines
  *   For this, I can send you the relevant part of our study program documentation. Please find the relevant information in the document.
  *   If you cannot find a place in a dormitory, you can look for shared flats for example on wg-gesucht.de<[URLREDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]
  *   For this matter, you need to contact TUM’s student information service desk: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/support-and-advice/support-during-studies/student-information
If you want to defer your admission to next year, you can do so. In this case, you now need to decline the offer online. Then, next year you apply again with all documents, however, you will be automatically admitted by the matriculation office since you already had received an offer. So, you won’t go through the selection process again next year.

[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] and I am an incoming master's student for the MSc AI in Society program starting this October. I am currently in the process of preparing my visa application and finalizing my scholarship. I have a few questions:
  1.  Where can I find the academic calendar for the MSc AI in Society program?
  2.  I would like to request the syllabus for the MSc AI in Society program, including details on the learning plan, competency standards, core competencies, main topics/materials, learning activities, competency achievement indicators for assessment, time allocation, and learning resources.
  3.  I have not yet secured accommodation, which is required for my visa. I have contacted several student dormitories, but they are either full, have closed their applications, or haven't responded to my messages. Could you assist me with this?
  4.  The name on all my documents ([REDACTED]) is different from the name on my passport ([REDACTED]). The embassy has requested that I renew my passport to match the name on my birth certificate. Could I update my name in TUMOnline and my Letter of Admission to reflect '[REDACTED]'? (I attach the document for the proof)
Thank you
