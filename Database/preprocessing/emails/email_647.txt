Betreff: AI in Society application
[REDACTED],
I am currently registered at TUM and will finish my studies in Master of [REDACTED] this semester.
I am highly interested in the master of AI in society, however, I have some doubts and questions if my background matches.
Would it be possible for you to arrange a meeting for me to help me in this regard?
