I hope this email finds you well. I am writing you regarding my application for the Masters's degree in 'AI in Society'.
I started the process last week, but I found it a bit confusing. Specifically, I am unsure about the status of my application. Could you provide me with an update on whether it has been accepted?
In my application portal it says that  "Application documents": not checked yet even though the Required documents (for admission) have been uploaded.
I have attached some screenshots of the application to help clarify my request.
Thank you in advance for your help.
