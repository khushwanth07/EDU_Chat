Q: How do I enter my practical projects in the application portal?
A: You will be provided a form to fill in your projects, where you will need to enter the title of the project, as well as a project description. The project description should clearly and concisely explain the content of the project, as well as highlight the interdisciplinary aspect. Please do not simply copy a generic module description in this field, as it will not be evident to us what you worked on.If your project modules are based on ECTS, please also enter the amount of ECTS for each project.If your project modules are not based on ECTS, or you are entering projects which you completed outside of university, please leave the field for ECTS empty. https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/
