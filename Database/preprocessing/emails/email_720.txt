[REDACTED],
Hi, I am a student at TUM-BWL and am planning to apply for the master's program in AI in society.
I have questions regarding the aptitude test.
  1.  The aptitude test covers four different fields. Could you specify which aspects of these fields will be included?
  2.  Are there any recommended books or references to help prepare for the aptitude test?
