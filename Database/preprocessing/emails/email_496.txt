Dear applicant,
The comment for the rejection states: “Interdisciplinarity aspect not fulfilled sufficiently. Projects should combine technical and social aspects, not deal with them separately.”
So, it is not about having uploaded a wrong document. It is an explanation for why we had to reject your application.
We wish you all the best!
Best wishes

Betreff: qusetion about application
Dear application team:
 I hope this letter finds you well.
 My application number is 1-00856783. Could you please allow me to upload a correct document?
 I was notified that my document was incorrect 2 hours ago. And less than 1 hour ago i recieved the rejection.
 However, i did not have the time to upload my correct document.
 I would really appreciate it if you can give me time to upload my correct document so that my document can be reconsidered.
