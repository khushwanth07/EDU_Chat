Thank you for your email.
Please guide me with the test link so I can proceed further with the test on a given time and date.
Furthermore, I couldn't upload one missing document within due time on my TUM portal.
Please find attached document proof of the projects at my bachelors time.
Regardless, it is very important for me to be a part of this prestigious institution. I dont want to miss out the admission in this institution so I request you to proceed my application for the next step in admission.
I shall be grateful to you for this act of kindness

Dear applicants of the M.Sc. AI in Society at TUM,
we are currently receiving many inquiries from people who have not yet received an invitation to the aptitude test tomorrow. We apologize for the confusion - the reason is the following:
we received a large number of applications, which we unfortunetely didn't manage to check in time for the test date on June 26th (tomorrow). Therefore, we have a group of people who did not receive any feedback from us yet.
We will proceed the following way: there will be a second test date on July 16th, from 10:45 - 12:15 CEST. Should you be one of the applicants who did not yet hear back from us (and were not declined either), please await further feedback regarding your application in the coming weeks from us. We will finish checking the remaining applicants and invite you to the second test, should all your documents suffice. You do not need to worry about the exam tomorrow.
If you already received an invitation to the test tomorrow, please ignore this email. For you, the test is still being held tomorrow.
We apologize for the confusion this might have caused and hope for your understanding.
Best wishes,
[REDACTED]
