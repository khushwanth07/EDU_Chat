Please disregard my previous email. I went ahead and accepted my offer of enrollment.
When you have a moment, could you confirm that I am enrolling as a German national and thus will not be charged for tuition?
Or if this information is in my portal, would you mind telling me how to find this?
Thank you

Great meeting you the other day for my AI in Society interview. I am so thankful to have been admitted and am excited on this new journey. However, I do have a few questions.
I saw online that I'd have to decline the admission and then reapply for the following year. If I chose to go this route, would I be admitted again next year ie for winter 2024 or would I be at risk of not being accepted?
Also, I am unable to find the acceptance deadlines anywhere on the website. I may be overlooking them, but if you are able to inform me of when I need to accept/decline (for deferment) it would be greatly appreciated.
Regards
