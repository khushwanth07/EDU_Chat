Since you are transferring to the LMU, and not TUM, you should contact them instead.

[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],
[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] and I am an international student from China. I am currently studying the Masterâ€™s program in [REDACTED] at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. I am considering transferring to the AI Master's program at [REDACTED] University of Munich (LMU) after completing my first year.
Could you please inform me whether I would need to provide a VPD (preliminary review documentation) certification as part of my application process for the transfer?
Thank you very much for your assistance. I look forward to your guidance.
