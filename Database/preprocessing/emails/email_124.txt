I hope this message finds you well. My name is [REDACTED], and I am originally from Azerbaijan. Currently, I am completing my degree in Poland, which is an EU country. I am interested in applying for the AI in Society program at the Technical University of Munich for the winter semester of 2025/26.
I have recently learned that tuition fees are charged for international students from third countries who enroll in a degree program starting from the winter semester of 2024/25. As a student from Azerbaijan but completing my current studies in Poland, I would like to clarify whether I would be required to pay these tuition fees upon applying to the AI in Society program.
Could you please provide me with information on whether my current status as a student in an EU country affects the tuition fee requirements for my application?
Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.
