[REDACTED],
Please excuse the late reply.
As far as I can see in the system, your CV is fine. There is no issue marked. Maybe this got resolved in the meantime.
As for the VPD, the comment says:
You have indicated that you have applied for the VPD in full. Your proof of this has been received and provisionally OK. The document is now only set to "not OK" so that you can upload the final VPD here. Uni-assist will email you the final VPD once it is complete. Please upload the final VPD for TUM here as soon as you receive it. However, if we then discover that your documents have not been received by [REDACTED] in full by the deadline, you will be excluded from the application process.
I think you mentioned that you already submitted a VPD to your previous application to TUM. Depending on how old this one is, you can submit it here again (as far as I am concerned, we accept VPDs that are up to 3 years old). Otherwise, you must submit a new VPD.
Best wishes

Betreff: Re: Need for VPD, when I have already a TUM Master degree
Good morning [MANUALL_REDACTED],
after the review of my docs, I received the following:
"
In our review of your application documents, we found the following documents classified as "incorrect" (not ok):
Preliminary review documentation (VPD) or Confirmation that the application for a VPD by uni-assist has been submitted in due form and time
"
"
In our review of your application documents, we found the following documents classified as "incorrect" (not ok):
Complete and current Résumé (CV)
"
1. I was not asked for it before.
But now checking the system, it appeared a request for this new doc:
"Preliminary review documentation (VPD) or Confirmation that the application for a VPD by uni-assist has been submitted in due form and time"
Why was it not there before?
So what should I do now?
2. What exactly is wrong with my CV?
I did it using the Europass website, and included everything that I could there.
Is it because is missing a Photo, maybe?
I included it in attachment, so you can check.

Thank you for your e-mail. If you were not asked for a VPD anywhere, it should be fine.
Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. Meaning that if something is missing in your application, you will be contacted again. If everything is fine, you will also get informed. This might happen over the next 2-3 weeks.

I sent the complete application today. Therefore, it seems that is not needed the VPD.
How long more or less does it take to get an answer in the application ?
Thanks.

I was the one today making the question if it is needed to ask for the VPD when I have already a [REDACTED] from TUM.
When doing the application for AI & Society, there is no place to insert the VPD. So, can I assume that I don't have to upload the VPD? It already shows me my previous Master as the Entrance qualification for Master's Program. Therefore, is it all good?
