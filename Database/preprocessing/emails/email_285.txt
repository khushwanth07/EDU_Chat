Betreff: Acceptance letter.
[REDACTED],
As an International student, I have to pay fees which 4000euro per semester. Inorder to fund my studies I am taking an educational loan.
Is it possible by any chance that in the acceptance letter the semester fees could be mentioned?
I know the letter is auto generated but I need to show semester fees to show then it would be way easier for me to get my edu loan.
Yours
