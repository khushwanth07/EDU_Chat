Hello,
  I trust that this email finds you safe and sound. I would like to apply for tuition fees waiver. I was in doubt during the application period as I did not find a place on the portal, through which I can upload the documents. Therefore, I wonder if you may assist me as I need to apply for a waiver. Thank you
