[REDACTED],
Thank you for reaching back out and sending your documents.
Unfortunately, your previous studies do not fulfil the minimum requirements of mathematics/statistics background. Our examination regulation explicitly states “5 ECTS of mathematics and/or statistics obtained as part of previous study programs”. Therefore, I’m afraid, you cannot make up for this requirement through participation in online courses.
If you have more questions, feel free to reach back out. Otherwise, I’m wishing you best of success on your future path.

I have attached two transcripts:
  *   bachelor's - informatics (1.5 ECTS) and economics (1.5 ECTS),
  *   masters- microeconomics (4 ECTS) and macroeconomics (4 ECTS)
If not, would you accept additional course credits earned through MOOC learning?
