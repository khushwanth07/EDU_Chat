I hope this message finds you well.
[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] and I am writing to inquire about the eligibility requirements for the Master of Science in [REDACTED] in Society at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I completed my undergraduate studies in [REDACTED] from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2017, with a CGPA of 3.22 out of 4.
Although my academic background is in [REDACTED], I have developed a strong interest in the field of [REDACTED] and have accumulated some of the relevant technical experience.
Given my STEM background and technical experience, I am eager to understand how I might qualify for your program. Could you please provide information regarding the prerequisites and any additional requirements for applicants with a non-ICT undergraduate degree?
Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response and guidance on how I can align my background with the admission criteria for this exciting program.
