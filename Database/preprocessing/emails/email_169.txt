[REDACTED],
mache ich gerne, schick es mir gerne zu.
[REDACTED],
Kann ich Dir so einen Brief erstellen und du unterschreibst ihn? [REDACTED] unten scheint eine formlose Bestätigung vom Department zu brauchen, wo er den Studienplatz bekommen hat, dass wir seine Englischkenntnisse als ausreichend anerkannt haben. Für [REDACTED].

No actually , lettershould be like the M.Sc AI in Society department had looked at my application and confirmed that I as an applicant have enough english skills to enroll for the master program.
Even this matter written on TUM letterhead with anyone’s signature from dept will work.

They most probably mean that you need to get it from the department you actually received your degree from. We cannot issue you a verification of English language proficiency, as you have not studied with us.

I hope this email finds you well.
I am writing to request a letter from the university verifying my English language proficiency. [REDACTED] in India requires this document for my visa application, as my IELTS score is 1 year old. ( even though validity for IELTS is 2 years)
I would like to highlight that the proficiency requirement for the Master's program is 6.5 bands (B2 CEFR), and I have scored 8 bands (C1 CEFR). Also my entire bachelors was done in english. In addition, I can also show more than 15 ECTS credits worth of bachelor's thesis and papers written entirely in English.
I have contacted  [REDACTED]@tum.d[IMAGE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]ailto:[REDACTED]@tum.de>  they said I have to get it from the department. Can you provide it ?
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
