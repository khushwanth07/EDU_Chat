Body:
[REDACTED]. [MANUALL_REDACTED],
Thank you for your e-mail and your interest in our Masters program.
Regarding the scope of the 18 ECTS, you bring along sufficient experience, since we also count practical experience outside of university (i.e. work experience, internships, etc). The way we make this ECTS-comparable is by calculating from hours to credits (1 ECTS credit = 30 hrs). So your in total 7 months of internships/jobs would cover the requirement.
The problem might rather be concerning the content of your practical experiences: what do you mean exactly by legal/tax area? When we are screening applications, we are looking for interdisciplinarity in the applicantâ€™s project(s) and strongly require a practical aspect in the form of implementation(programming), some kind of data analysis, or similar, applied to some sort of field in society (which would, in your case, be the legal/tax area).
If you could elaborate to me shortly what exactly you did during your internships, I can tell you whether or not this would pass the requirements of AI in Society.

Betreff: Application question
[REDACTED]. [MANUALL_REDACTED],
my name is [REDACTED] and I studied Law and Economics at the University of Augsburg. I am really interested in your Master's program AI in Society.
My question is therefore whether I meet the criteria required for admission:
- The scope of my degree program is 180 ECTS
- This results in 79 ECTS in the legal field and 101 ECTS in the business field
- The academic degree is Bachelor of Science
- I have practical experience through a mandatory internship of 2 months, a 3-month working student job and a 3-month internship. (all in the legal and tax area)
My question would also be whether I fulfill the requirement of the practical project worth at least 18 ECTS or whether I can make up for it during the course of my studies?
Yours
