For proof, you will also have to provide your Transcript of Records when youâ€™re applying. This module should also be listed there.

Betreff: Inquiring about the application requirement of AI in Society
[REDACTED],
I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the application requirement of AI in Society.
As part of the application requirements, it is required to complete a practical projec. [REDACTED]'s Thesis is about the use of intelligent algorithms to enhance the energy efficiency of environmental systems.
Given the project was conducted and written in Chinese, I want to ask:
  1.What format should the documentation of the completed project take?
  2. Since my thesis was not written in English, would the original thesis document, accompanied by an English introduction summarizing it, suffice as proof of the project's completion?
  3. Is there any additional material or information that I should provide?
Thank you for considering my inquiry. I look forward to your guidance.
