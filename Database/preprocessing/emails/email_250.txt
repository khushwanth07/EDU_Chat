Betreff: Information regarding scholarships
[REDACTED],
I have been recently admitted to the Master’s program in AI in Society at TUM.
I have been a student of TUM and now want to continue with my second masters in AI in Society.
I have checked that I am in the bracket of paying tution fees for each semester.
Can you tell me whether I can still apply for any scholarship program to finance my studies?
Any information on scholarship will be highly appreciated!
