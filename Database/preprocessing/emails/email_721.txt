In any case: to be admitted to any study program, you need to apply through TUM’s official application website. Professors cannot admit you themselves. You can find more information here: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/application/application-info-portal/online-application

I guess this Email is related to the application for the MSc. AI in Society, right? In that case, Ms. [REDACTED] will send a link to the application portal.

Betreff: Master's degree seeking student from [MANUALL_REDACTED] University
[REDACTED],
I hope you are having a great day. I am İsmail Eren [MANUALL_REDACTED] senior year student at [MANUALL_REDACTED] University Electrical and [REDACTED]. I want to do my Master’s in engineering area and I am thinking that TUM will be perfect for my desires and goals. I am interested in [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I am writing you this email because I looked your studies and I think my Master’s degree under your supervision will improve me and broaden my horizon in engineering area. Currently I am doing my senior Project design with Proffessor [MANUALL_REDACTED] [MANUALL_REDACTED] from our department about developing Low-Cost LiDAR robot which is 3d mapping the indoor environment with 1D laser sensor as capable as a 3D LiDAR sensor but with a lot minimized cost. I am also working part-time at INNOVA as communication system’s engineering. I also did one of my internships in Berlin, DAI-Lab TU Berlin under the supervision of [REDACTED]. [MANUALL_REDACTED] [MANUALL_REDACTED]. I worked about autonomous driving and its simulations. I want to further develop myself in these areas. If you consider me as your student for Master’s for next year, I would be very appreciated.
I added my transcript and cv to this email. If you can contact me, I would be happy.
