Thank you for choosing a timeslot (9.7. 12:30-13:00) for your interview.
Unfortunately, one of the interviewers has a time conflict now and wonâ€™t be able to make it. Therefore, I would kindly ask you to choose a different timeslot from the ones that are still available.
Please let me know if there are any problems.
Thank you for your cooperation and best wishes
