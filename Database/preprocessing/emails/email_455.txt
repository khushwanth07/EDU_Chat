Betreff: Re: AI in Society: Invitation to [REDACTED]
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
first of all thank you very much for the quick check and approval of my submitted documents.
Before going through all the details of the proctoring program I wanted to ask a more general question regarding the aptitude assessment itself. As a German student I am used to the term "Eignungsverfahren" which pretty much translates to "aptitude assessment" - from my experience that means the documents are alright and this is the last step which decides whether I am eligible to join the master's program or not.
Is this assumption correct or is it just the first among other tests to follow?
Yours
