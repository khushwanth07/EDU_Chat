Regarding scholarships, I would kindly redirect you to TUM’s scholarship office. For more information and their contact, please see here: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/fees-and-financial-aid/scholarships
If your degree program was taught in English, you do not need to provide us an IELTS test or similar. Please instead get a confirmation about the language of instruction from your university, as you’re suggesting.

[REDACTED]،
Thank you for your reply.
Seeking further support please on the below inquiries:
1) does DAAD scholarship apply?
2) if yes, then shall I apply both applications separately? Please help me have clarity on the process .
3) I graduated from the American University of Cairo taught in English. Do i still need to get an IELTS? Or shall I get a documentation from the University confirming my education in English?
