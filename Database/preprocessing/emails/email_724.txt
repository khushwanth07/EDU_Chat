[REDACTED]. [MANUALL_REDACTED],
Thank you for your interest in the M.Sc. AI in Society.
We currently cannot give definitive answers surrounding the aptitude test. However, we will publish a short FAQ answering such questions in time.
Regarding the practical project: if you have completed at least 18 ECTS (your bachelor's thesis can also be counted) in a/multiple practical project(s), which involve a) some sort of technical tools and b) some societal aspect, we highly encourage you to apply. If you have the 18 ECTS, but aren't quite sure if the topics of your projects fit perfectly, please apply regardless.
If you have any more questions, please reach back out to me.
Best wishes,
[REDACTED]

[REDACTED],
I am writing to you regarding the aptitude test for the application for the MSc. AI in Society.
I am a student in my final semester of my BSc. in [REDACTED] at the HFP and have developed an interest specifically surrounding the topic of AI.
As I am currently getting ready to apply for Master's programs, I wanted to ask what this aptitude test would exactly entail and how one could prepare for it. 
I also wanted to confirm with you if I have the 18 Credits needed in practical projects. 
Would you be available for a short meeting this week or the coming? 
Best,
[REDACTED]
