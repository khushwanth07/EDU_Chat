Thank you for your email and your interest in the MSc. AI in Society.
To answer your questions:
  1.  Yes, we also count Bachelor’s theses as practical projects, as long as the contents are suitable. The important thing here is then that the thesis meets the 18 ECTS requirement (if the thesis is the only project you’re submitting), and that it is finished at the time of application. If it does not show up on your transcript, we cannot count it!
  2.  It is not necessary to submit English certificates, if instead you can prove your knowledge to us by “English as language of instruction” during your Bachelor’s studies, or if your thesis was written in English. For more information, please see at the bottom of this page under “FAQ”: https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/
  3.  All of the relevant admission criteria and procedures you can find on our website here: https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/
Best wishes and a happy new year,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request additional information regarding the admission requirements for the AI in Society master’s program (starting from October). Specifically, I would like to understand if I meet the necessary criteria based on my academic and professional background.
Here is a brief overview of my profile:
·  I am a Czech student currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in [REDACTED] at VŠEM University in Prague, which I am set to complete in January 2025.
·  My GPA, converted to the German grading system, is 1.5.
·  As part of the Erasmus+ program, I spent 4 months at TH Köln, studying in the Code & Context program.
·  I have completed two internships at Forvia, an automotive company, in the digitalization department (one in Germany, one in the [REDACTED]), and I am currently engaged in a third internship with the same company in the [REDACTED].
·  I have successfully completed a B2 English course at my home university and an A1.2 course at TH Köln, both with the highest possible grades.
I am particularly seeking clarification on the following:
1.      Regarding the practical project, would the Bachelor thesis be sufficient as I am writing about Industry 4.0 and its implementation?
2.      Is it necessary to submit an English proficiency certificate such as TOEFL or IELTS, or would my completed English and German courses be sufficient for this requirement?
3.      Are there any other specific admission criteria I should be aware of or additional steps I might need to take?
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.
