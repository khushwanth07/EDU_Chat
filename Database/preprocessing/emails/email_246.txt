Betreff: Enrollment - AI in Society
[REDACTED]!
I am working to get all of my documents needed for enrollment at TUM. Regarding the Transcripts and Degrees my Universities have primarily switched to E-[REDACTED] and Transcripts and are doing away with hard copy.
If I have a digital version of these - can I email them in/upload/ OR print them out and mail them in with a notary?
