Betreff: Credit to ECTS Conversion, 5-[REDACTED], [REDACTED]: 1-[MANUALL_REDACTED], [REDACTED]
[REDACTED],
My name is [REDACTED], my application number is 1-[MANUALL_REDACTED], and my applicant number is 2-[MANUALL_REDACTED].
I'm writing to express my concern about credit to ECTS conversion of my transcript.
I am a architecture student from Tongji University, China. And my bachelor program is a five-year program, which is normal for a Bachelor of Architecture degree. So it means according to 30 ECTS pro semester, my program will include 300 ECTS as total. In my training program, the credits needed to graduate is 204 credits in five years. So the conversion rate from my credit to ECTS will be about 1.5.
In the attachment, you can find the training program of my five-year architecture program, which is originally in Chinese and google translated into English. If you need any other materials of information, please feel free to contact me.
As in the proof of passing module in mathematics, I have 4 credits in mathematics course, which is equal to 6 ECTS. This has already surpassed the requirement.
Please consider the five-year program for architecture students in reviewing my application materials. Thank you for your patience!
Best wishes,
[REDACTED]
