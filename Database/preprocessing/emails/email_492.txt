As we are stating on our website, the test will be held online. You don’t need to come in person.

Betreff: The place of examination
[REDACTED]：
The aptitude assessment includes examination during 25th June, may I know whether the test will provide the online form or need I show up there in person.
I extremely hope that the online form would provided since the visa requriement and the expensive plane ticket would be the heavy burden for me and I might lose the opportunity of this program since I really have keen on it.
I would be appreciated for your reply.
Kind regards，
[MANUALLY REDACTED]
