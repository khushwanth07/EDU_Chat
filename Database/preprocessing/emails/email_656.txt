Everything is correct in the system (regarding the application and applicant numbers), there is no issue.
PS: Iâ€™ve read your other e-mail and will answer your questions as soon as I can. Sometimes I simply need to double check with other colleagues in order to give you the correct information regarding non-standard questions.

Betreff: Fwd: Applicant - VPD [REDACTED]
Hello,
I submitted an application for the AI in [REDACTED] of Science program. I submitted my VPD placeholder waiting to hear from UNI ASSIST.
For the "[REDACTED]" section I put in the application number and cannot change it so I am emailing it.
[REDACTED] for my application is 2-[MANUALL_REDACTED]
[REDACTED] for my application is 1-[MANUALL_REDACTED].
I put down the latter when it should be the former. If someone could please help me fix this or atleast acknowledge this email so it does not impact my application it would be greatly appreciated.
Regards
[REDACTED]
