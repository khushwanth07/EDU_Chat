I was just going to choose the project week I want to participate in. For this, I was wondering if this project week class will also be awarded 6 ECTS so that I can use it for my project week module?
Best,

we introduced a new project week where you will have the chance to develop an AI-based chatbot for study counseling, with our AI in Society program serving as the first use case. The goal is to create a chatbot that provides accurate answers to frequently asked questions from students and prospective applicants using curated information.
During this project, you will:
  *   Work with cutting-edge technologies in [REDACTED] (AI) and [REDACTED] (NLP) to design a user-friendly solution.
  *   Learn and apply key AI concepts in a hands-on, practical setting.
  *   Help position the AI in Society program at the forefront of responsible AI-powered study counseling.
We are looking for students who are passionate about programming and enthusiastic about exploring natural language processing and chatbot development.
You can register for the course at https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/slc.tm.cp/student/courses/[NUMBER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]?$scrollTo=toc_overview. If you have any questions, feel free to contact [REDACTED] at [REDACTED]@tum.d[IMAGE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]ailto:[REDACTED]@tum.de>.
