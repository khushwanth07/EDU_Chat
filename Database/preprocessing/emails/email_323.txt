For me, on kulibri it shows that you chose 09:00 – 09:30. It could be that you are in a different timezone (CEST+3?), since the website seems to adjust the times to the user’s timezone, as we later figured out.
In any case, your interview will be tomorrow, 09:00 – 09:30 CEST.
Best,

[REDACTED], hope you are doing well.
[REDACTED], I chose the 12.00-12.30 am CEST time slot, however, this email says that it is at 9-9.30.
I can be available in both slots, there is no problem. I just wanted to clarify which one is correct.
