[REDACTED],
Thank you for your interest in the M.Sc. AI in Society.
If your language of instruction was English, this is already sufficient. Here is an excerpt of the regulation:
If you wish to submit a confirmation of your language of instruction as proof of your English language proficiency, the confirmation has to be issued by an administrative unit of the university (e.g. [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED]) on official university paper and has to bear a seal and an original signature.
You can also find this information here (https://www.tum.de/en/studies/application/application-info-portal/glossary-of-documents) under “[REDACTED]”.
If you have more questions, please reach back out to me.

Betreff: [REDACTED] of [REDACTED] for Master's Application
[REDACTED]/Madam,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is [REDACTED], and I am writing to inquire about the English language proficiency certificate requirement for applying to the Master's program in AI in Society.
I completed my undergraduate degree in China and subsequently pursued a Master's degree at [REDACTED] University of [REDACTED] (CUHK), where English was the language of instruction. Given that my Master's program was conducted entirely in English, I am wondering if I am eligible for a waiver of the requirement to provide an IELTS or TOEFL certificate with my application.
Could you please confirm whether my completion of a Master's program in an English-taught curriculum at CUHK exempts me from submitting an English proficiency certificate? If so, would it be necessary for CUHK to provide a document verifying that English was the language of instruction during my Master's studies?
I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your guidance regarding the application process.
Thank you for your time and assistance.
