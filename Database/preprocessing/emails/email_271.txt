Betreff: [REDACTED] for AI in [REDACTED]'s Program
[REDACTED]. [REDACTED],
I hope this message finds you well. My name is [REDACTED], and I recently applied for the AI in Society master's program. I have completed the written test and attended the interview on July 10th. Despite being informed during the interview that I had received an offer, I have since received an invitation for an aptitude test.
After my interview, the interviewer mentioned that I had secured an offer and advised me to begin looking for accommodation. They also indicated that the formal offer would be sent to my email shortly thereafter. However, some of my peers who interviewed on the same day have already received their formal offers.
Could you please provide an estimate of when I might expect to receive the formal offer? This information is crucial for me as I need the offer to proceed with my visa and other necessary arrangements.
Thank you for your understanding and assistance.
