Thank you for your email.
I went through the off campus DEMO exam several times before it was closed (9:00 AM). However, it doesn't display the payment page for me and I couldn't process the payment.

For completing the payment, you need to go through the off campus DEMO exam. In there, you will find instructions on downloading proctorio and payment.
If you still have difficulties, please let me know.

I hope this message finds you well.
I am writing to request a seat for the exam in the second round, since I am having difficulty processing my aptitude test fee.
Thank you for your assistance.

Dear applicants of the M.Sc. AI in Society at TUM,
we are currently receiving many inquiries from people who have not yet received an invitation to the aptitude test tomorrow. We apologize for the confusion - the reason is the following:
we received a large number of applications, which we unfortunetely didn't manage to check in time for the test date on June 26th (tomorrow). Therefore, we have a group of people who did not receive any feedback from us yet.
We will proceed the following way: there will be a second test date on July 16th, from 10:45 - 12:15 CEST. Should you be one of the applicants who did not yet hear back from us (and were not declined either), please await further feedback regarding your application in the coming weeks from us. We will finish checking the remaining applicants and invite you to the second test, should all your documents suffice. You do not need to worry about the exam tomorrow.
If you already received an invitation to the test tomorrow, please ignore this email. For you, the test is still being held tomorrow.
We apologize for the confusion this might have caused and hope for your understanding.
Best wishes,
[REDACTED]
