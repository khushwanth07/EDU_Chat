This form to fill in the best credits will be provided to you inside the application portal, as soon as you start filling out your application. There is no public excel sheet.
It also doesn’t need to be additionally approved by your university. You should upload your official transcript of records, however. But the application portal will guide you through the documents you need to submit either way.
