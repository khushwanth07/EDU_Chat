Just a short info: according to [MANUALL_REDACTED] & [MANUALL_REDACTED] we should first wait how many people approximately apply, and then start preparing the test. They proposed mid/end of April for the test preparations. Just letting you know, since last time we talked we said “let’s tackle this mid March”. 😊
Have a nice Sunday!
