I would like to take the aptitude test at the university with human proctoring, i.e. without the proctoring software and without paying fees for the same. I have also chosen this exam option on the Moodle exam page for the test. Could you also share where this in-person exam will take place at the TUM? Looking forward to a confirmation.
Best,
