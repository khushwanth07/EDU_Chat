I must have missed the email. That was the reason why I could not log in. I just logged in and I chose an option. Everything seems to be working now! Appreciate your help very much. If there is a problem, I will make sure to contact you again. Thank you one more time!

You seem to have been logging in with your normal TUM credentials. You need to log in with the login sent to you by moodle for this test (your username specifically should be: ais24-153).
Could you try it like this and let us know shortly? If you can‚Äôt find the credentials, we can send them to you again (CC @[MANUALLY REDACTED]<mailto:[REDACTED]@tum.de>).

It still does not work. I have just logged in with both of the options that I see (the same as on the screenshot you provided) and the only thing inside is an online moodle test for [REDACTED] (a subject that I already took). I have attached a screenshot below.
This morning I re-read all of the emails you sent and I remembered that you require a fee of $25. I have not paid it as I have not recieved a link where I can pay. Maybe this is where the problem comes from?
Thank you again for your cooperation!

No reason to wait longer, it should work now.
How are you logging in? When you open the link I sent you, you should see two options (see screenshot attached). Please try the different sign-in option from the one you used up until now.
Let me know.
Best,

Thank you for your help but for some reason, it still does not show up on my moodle page. Maybe I should wait a bit longer?

I have just checked, and you have been enrolled in the moodle exam, so everything should work.
Are you accessing it through the following link: https://exam.moodle.tum.de ?

Thank you for your email! However, I do not have an option for an exam on my moodle page. My name is [REDACTED] and my MatrNr is [MANUALLY REDACTED]. May I ask for help?
Thank you in advance!
Looking forward to hearing from you,

Dear applicants,
as a short clarification: please choose the option about off-site or on-site on the moodle exam page, not via an email to me. Please look for "Select your exam option here".
Thank you!
Best,
