Betreff: [REDACTED] // [REDACTED] // AI in Society
[REDACTED]. [MANUALLY REDACTED],
In preparation for the online aptitude test this 26.06.2024 for the master program "AI in Society", I wanted to further inform myself on the allowed materials that one can have on their desk.
The dedicated forum mentions only a calculator as a permitted tool. However, are any of these other materials allowed during the examination:
- a pen;
- a blank piece of paper;
- a glass of water?
Thank you in advance for your guidance.
With
