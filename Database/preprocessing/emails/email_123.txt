To answer your questions:
  *   We do not filter by specific bachelor’s backgrounds, as long as you fulfil the requirements we also present on our website: https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/. So yes, you can also apply with your French degree, as long as it spanned at least 6 semesters, and you fulfilled at least 140 ECTS credits.
  *   We don’t specifically offer working student programs. Normally what people do in Germany, is to apply for working student jobs on their own, independently from the study program.
I hope this information was helpful to you. If you have further questions, please reach back out.
Best wishes

I’m very interested in TU Munich’s Ai master’s program and had few questions:
-          Do you accept the French equivalent of bachelors degree (3 years) in electronics, electric energy and automation, for this program?
-          Do you offer a working student program in parallel to this one (AKA “co-op” or “apprenticeship”), or any of your engineering master’s programs ?
