[REDACTED],
Thank you for your email and your interest in our Masterâ€™s program.
We are open for applications from students of various backgrounds â€“ i.e., we donâ€™t filter them based on the field of the Bachelorâ€™s degree or work experience. However, what is important, is that you fulfil our application requirements, which you can also find on our website here: https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/
In this context, for example, your work experience would be very relevant for fulfilling the practical project component. You need to make sure that your previous study degree(s) can show at least 5 credit points from a mathematical/statistical subject (you can find all this information, again, on the website).
Therefore, please go through the information on there and assess whether you are matching those requirements. If you have further questions after that, please reach back out to me.
Best wishes
