To answer your questions:
  1.  We are planning to conduct the classes of the first semester both in-person and stream in parallel online.
  2.  There is no exact recommended time you should be arriving in Munich physically. However, I would highly recommend you take care of accommodation as soon as possible. You can either familiarize yourself with the dorms of the Studentenwerk (main dorms for all universities in Munich): [URLREDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] or look independently for e.g. shared flats on other websites, such as wg-gesucht. [REDACTED], it is not so easy to find an accommodation â€“ the sooner you take care of it, the better.
  3.  Classes at TUM will officially start on October 14th. Regarding a specific timetable for the first semester, please check back soon on our website.
Best wishes
