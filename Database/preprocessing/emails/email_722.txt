Ich muss mal wieder eine Anfrage an Dich weiterleiten...
Wie ist das, wenn die Person zwar die praktische Erfahrung mitbringt, aber nicht im Rahmen des Studiums (siehe E-Mail unten). D.h. sie kann keine ECTS nachweisen. Wie gehen wir mit sowas um?

I come from [REDACTED] and I finished my bachelor’s degree in [REDACTED] with focus on [REDACTED].
I am very interested in the AI for society program, and would like to ask about the requirement, specifically regarding the practical project.
Does the practical project need to be recognized with credits, i.e. does it have to be part of my university course? Would individual projects or volunteer experience be able to also contribute to the requirement? E.g. I won a competition to generate an electricity-management model that reduces campus electricity cost. I also conducted environmental education and practice on the topic of clothing waste and wind power generators for elementary school.
Can the project be part of a course or does it have to stand indiviually? E.g. course “introduction to medical engineering” incorporates a small project, would this count?
If from my university, I do not officially 18 credits for a practical project in social science, is there a way to make up for this requirement? E.g. by compiling my own project, Kaggle, etc.
Thank you very much for your help and answer in advance.
