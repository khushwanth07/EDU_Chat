Betreff: Fw: AI in Society: Invitation to [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]/Madam,
My name is [REDACTED], and I recently applied to the AI in Society master's program. However, I am feeling quite nervous regarding the aptitude test and wanted to ask if you could give me some tips on what I should focus on and the depth of the knowledge that is expected.
Also, I noticed that an on-site exam would be offered. However, I could not find any details regarding the exam room. Could you please clarify the location of the on-site exam if the room has been set already, or we will receive an update later regarding this?
Thank you in advance, and I am looking forward to your reply.
