My name is Bohdan and I have applied for the Master's programme "AI in
Society" at TUM.
I am writing to you, because I couldn't find the information on my
own. I have read that after applying I have to pass an aptitude test.
It is also written that the test aims to assess my knowledge in
politics, economics, maths, etc. I also read a file called
"Description of the aptitude assessment (appendix 2, German)".
However, there is no information there that I was looking for.
Could you please provide me with information on what topics will be
covered in the test? I mean what should I repeat from what I have
already studied in order to successfully pass the test? I am worried
about admission, therefore I want to score as high as possible, but it
is impossible without repetition.
I really hope for your understanding.
Yours faithfully,
[REDACTED]
