[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]
I hope this message finds you well. My name is [REDACTED] 
(Matrikelnummer: [NUMBER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]), and I am eagerly looking forward to starting 
my first semester in the "AI in Society" program! However, I am 
currently facing some difficulties with my registration at TUM, as my 
bachelor’s certificates are not yet finalized.
Recently, fellow AIS students informed me about the [REDACTED] taking 
place on October 4th, which I would very much like to attend. This event 
seems like a great opportunity to meet my future classmates and 
professors, and to learn more about the program.
Given that my matriculation is still pending, I wanted to kindly inquire 
if it would be possible for me to participate in the [REDACTED] (and 
potentially AIS courses) without official enrollment at this stage.
I would greatly appreciate your guidance on this matter and thank you in 
advance for your time and assistance.
