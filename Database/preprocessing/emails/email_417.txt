I have just checked, and you have been enrolled in the moodle exam, so everything should work.
Are you accessing it through the following link: https://exam.moodle.tum.de ?
Best wishes

Thank you for your email! However, I do not have an option for an exam on my moodle page. My name is [REDACTED] and my MatrNr is [MANUALLY REDACTED]. May I ask for help?
Thank you in advance!
Looking forward to hearing from you,

Dear applicants,
as a short clarification: please choose the option about off-site or on-site on the moodle exam page, not via an email to me. Please look for "Select your exam option here".
Thank you!
Best,
[REDACTED]
