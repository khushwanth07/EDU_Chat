Q: I haven’t finished my bachelor’s degree yet. Can I apply regardless?
A: Yes. To apply to the MSc. AI in Society, we require you to have completed at least 140 ECTS credits worth of modules, but not to have finished your degree already. However, you will need to have finished it by the time you will be enrolling in TUM.
