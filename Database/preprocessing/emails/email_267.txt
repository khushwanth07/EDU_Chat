I have just checked your application status online, and some documents are still not marked as “OK”.
I will need to speak to the matriculation office about this, and let you know afterwards what you need to do.
Since this is very last-minute, I cannot invite you to the test tomorrow, since the documents won’t be assessed this fast. However, we will be holding a third test date, to which I will gladly invite you should all your documents be sufficient in the end.
I apologize for the long wait.

I really need your help and guidance to improve myself and do my best to save more lives- especially of children with heart-related issues- because they also deserve to live and experience life like us.
