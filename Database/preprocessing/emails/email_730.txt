Betreff: Inquiries about the AI in society programme practical project
Dear admission team,
I completed my undergraduate degree in the WiWi program at the University of Frankfurt, graduating with a grade of 2.4. If the top 140 credits are selected, my graduation grade could potentially improve to 2.3. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's program in [REDACTED] at University [REDACTED], a course that leans towards smart buildings in the healthcare sector. My master's thesis topic is on AI in the healthcare sector, and I am set to graduate this September. I was thrilled to learn about the new AI in Society program at TUM, as, despite my background in economics, I eagerly seek an opportunity to study data science and gain exposure to AI and large language models. This drove me to contemplate pursuing a second Master's degree.
During my undergraduate studies, I earned 30 credits in mathematics and statistics-related courses. My bachelor's thesis investigated digitalization in the healthcare, finance, and technology sectors, analyzing the application and future of AI in healthcare, as well as its risks. It was worth 12 credits and achieved a grade of 1.3. I have recently submitted a research proposal for my Master's thesis, which accounts for 60 credits. I wonder if these two theses could be considered as practical projects? I look forward to your reply.
Best wishes,
[REDACTED]
