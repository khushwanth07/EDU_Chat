The preference section indicates your preference regarding groups, for example if we had 3 different groups, you could indicate which group you would most like to visit (preference 1), or least (preference 3). Here we have formally just one group, so you can just choose preference 1.
It has nothing to do with your previous programming knowledge.
Best wishes and have a nice weekend
