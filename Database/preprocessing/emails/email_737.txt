Body:
[REDACTED],
Thank you for your interest in the M.Sc. AI in Society.
Generally, an additional Masterâ€™s degree (e.g. in MMT) does not provide particular benefits for you regarding the application process, except for the (optional) motivational letter you can hand in. If you can incorporate your previous studies into a motivation of why you are particularly interested in the study program, please feel free to do so! You can find more information about this here<https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium-1/ai-in-society/application/>.
Otherwise, depending on your modules from the MMT program, you may hand in a request for recognition of those modules in case they are either the same lectures also taught in AIS (study program see here<https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium-1/ai-in-society/>), or equivalent content-wise. For this you have time until up to one year after admission to the AIS program.
Regarding your question about fees: there are no particular exceptions. For general information about fees for international students, I would kindly refer you to this<https://www.tum.de/en/studies/fees/tuition> website.
Please feel free to reach back out if you have further questions.

Betreff: Inquiry about [REDACTED] in AI in Society and [REDACTED]
[REDACTED],
I hope this email finds you well. I am currently enrolled in the Master in Management and Technology (MMT) program, and I am writing my thesis on the topic of hyperpersonalization with generative AI. This area of study has sparked a deep interest in me, and I am eager to further deepen my knowledge in AI.
Given my current academic standing and the relevance of my thesis to the field of AI, I am considering applying for  MSc AI in Society. I believe that this would be a natural progression and a valuable addition to my current MMT degree.
Before I proceed with the application, I wanted to clarify a few points. Would my current MMT degree provide any exemptions or benefits during the application process? Also, would I still be required to pay the standard application fee, or are there any fee waivers or reductions available for current international students?
I appreciate your guidance on this matter and look forward to your response.
