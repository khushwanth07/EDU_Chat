[REDACTED],
Thank you for providing more information on your previous degree program – we have yet to check it.
I need to ask however another question: could you send me your transcript of records, please? I would like to see what remark is inserted there for the module you were failed for. If you have a letter of exmatriculation, that states the reason for exmatriculation, it would also be helpful if you sent it.
I would then check back with our matriculation office with your documents, so I can let you know for sure if you can apply like this or not. Because in this situation, it is really only about formalities from our university and cannot be decided by an interview with our admission committee or similar.
Would that be fine with you?
Thank you and best wishes

thank you for your prompt response!
Here is the curriculum for the Master's program:
Master’s Program - HS Aalen<[URLREDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]
As previously mentioned, I have successfully completed all my courses except one - due to the unfortunate circumstances I described earlier. While the program at HS Aalen offers a strong focus on programming, TUM’s program is distinguished by its comprehensive emphasis on governance, legal frameworks, and the societal implications of AI—areas that were not covered in my previous studies and that I would be thrilled to explore further.
Additionally, for your reference, here is the curriculum of my Bachelor's degree, where I minored in data analytics:
Bachelor’s Program - Sociology at ELTE<[URLREDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]
As I was unable to complete only one class due to - so to say - external circumstances, would it be possible to consider an exemption? Perhaps an oral interview with the admissions board could be arranged, or I could meet a higher standard in the assessment process to fully demonstrate both my knowledge and my strong dedication to joining your program.
It would be an incredible honour to study at such a prestigious institution as TUM and to gain a more holistic and advanced understanding of AI.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I wish you a [REDACTED]!

Thank you for your email and your interest in the MSc. AI in Society.
I’m very sorry to read what has happened to you – this sounds beyond frustrating. Thank you for explaining your situation in detail.
Now: in German universities, there is a notion of “endgültig nicht bestanden”, i.e. “finally/definitively failed”. This means, if you have finally failed a subject and you have therefore failed your degree, you are exempted from doing the same/similar degree anywhere else in Germany. I am assuming that you received an “endgültig nicht bestanden”.
Therefore, the first step here would be to check whether your degree (MSc. [REDACTED]) and our degree (MSc. AI in Society) are similar enough (“fachverwandt”). This check needs to be done by our program heads, but for this we need to know more details about your previous degree, i.e. which university, which modules are part of the curriculum, etc.
After we have done this check, there are two ways this could go:
1) Either we decide that the two degrees are not similar enough; then you can apply to us with no problems. Or:
2) We decide that the two degrees are highly similar; then you, unfortunately, would be declined by TUM.
Therefore, please let us know some more information about your previous degree. You can also just send us the website of the degree if it lists all relevant information.
Best wishes, happy holidays, and a happy new year,
[REDACTED]

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about my eligibility to apply for the AI in Society program at TUM.
Firstly, I am an international student who came to Germany for my masters study, after finishing my bachelors in my home country. During my previous studies in MSc [REDACTED] at a German public university, I encountered an unfortunate situation that resulted in my exmatriculation. The project in question was entirely my own work, but it was uploaded to GitHub without my consent by a co-worker from the company where I was completing my internship, whom I had trusted for a second opinion. This individual later admitted to uploading the project as an act of personal retaliation after I declined their romantic advances a week later.
Despite providing evidence to support my case (including transcripts, correspondence, and screenshots), the incident was ultimately classified as academic misconduct, and I was exmatriculated. This situation was devastating, as I was just 5 credit points away from completing my master's degree, having successfully passed all other exams (many with excellent grades), completed my internship, and already secured a master's thesis placement. I had successfully completed numerous challenging exams in technical subjects, all of which were on paper where cheating was not an option and never even crossed my mind. I am truly perplexed as to how my previous university could not see that this was simply a misunderstanding.
I am passionate about completing my education and am eager to continue contributing to this field. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss whether my application would still be considered in light of these circumstances.The circumstances are deeply regrettable, and measures have been taken to ensure such a situation cannot happen again.
Could you please advise whether this situation would impact my application to your program? I would be happy to provide further information or documentation if necessary.
Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your response.
