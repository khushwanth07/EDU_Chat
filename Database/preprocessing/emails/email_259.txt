You looking at your desk at your paper will not be counted as cheating, donâ€™t worry.
If there are any technical problems, there is a zoom call hotline as well as a phone number given on the moodle exam page.
Best wishes and good luck

[REDACTED]/Ma'am,
I will be taking the aptitude test tomorrow and have a query. The online proctoring system monitors and uses eye and head movement to check for any suspicious attempts. If I use a blank paper on my desk and do not look at the camera constantly, will that be counted as an attempt to cheat?
If there are some technical issues during the test tomorrow, is there a contact person or an email which I can use for help?
Thank you for your help in advance.
