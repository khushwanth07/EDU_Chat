Betreff: Master of Science in M.Sc - list of modules and fees
Dear TUM [REDACTED],
I hope this email finds you well.
I am writing to inquire about the Master of Science (M.Sc.) program in AI in Society offered at your esteemed institution. I am particularly interested in understanding the curriculum in detail. Could you kindly provide me with a list of modules that are conducted as part of this program?
Additionally, I would like to know the tuition fees for this Master's program, specifically for EU students.
Thank you very much for your assistance. I look forward to your response.
