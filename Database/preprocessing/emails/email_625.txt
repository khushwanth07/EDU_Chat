Betreff: Question about application of AI in Society
Dear study coordinator,
  I am an applicant of the TUM Master program AI in Society. I have a question about the document 'the best 140 credits'. The given form is not enough for me to fill in my courses which are equivalent to 140 credits. I wonder how to solve this problem.
  I am looking forward to your reply!
