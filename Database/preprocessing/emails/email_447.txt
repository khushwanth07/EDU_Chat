Betreff: Wg: AI in Society: Invitation to [REDACTED]
[REDACTED] or Madam,
Thank you very much for the invitation for the aptitude assessment.
I have a few technical questions for the test since
I am currently travelling in Vietnam.
1. Can I take the online test on a tablet, more specifically, can I install the monitoring software on it?
2. Can I use the software without any problems in Vietnam?
I highly appreciate a fast response so I can organise alternatives if necessary.
