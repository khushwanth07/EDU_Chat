Betreff: Application for TUM M.Sc. AI in [REDACTED] of completed practical project (18 ECTS)
Hello,
I have a query regarding the practical project requirement for the TUM M.Sc. program "AI in Society." The application guidelines state that applicants must demonstrate completion of a relevant practical project during their previous studies.
I completed a course titled "Introduction to AI (5 ECTS) and I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on AI chatbots, focusing on their various use cases (15 ECTS).  Please let me know if this meets the criteria for the practical project requirement.
Here is a link to my thesis:
