I have now heard back, and this is what she’s saying:
They are missing a notarized Transcript of Records which lists all of your modules and their grades (from [REDACTED] University). I don’t know how exactly the document looks like that they have from you currently, but apparently they can only see a summary of average grades for each semester. And this is what seems to be insufficient. She also said that there is no workaround around this, and no other document they would accept instead.
Does this make sense? Because I can only see the documents that you uploaded online, I don’t know what exactly they have received via physical mail. Maybe you can get in contact with her directly: [REDACTED]@zv.tum.d[IMAGE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]ailto:[REDACTED]@zv.tum.de> (her name is [REDACTED]).
Please feel free to keep me in CC. I’m very sorry that I still can’t give you another way out here. Maybe you can ask to speak to her on the phone, so you come to a solution quicker?
About your encounter at the Center of Study and Learning you emailed me about earlier: I am super sorry to hear – this should not happen and is not our standard at TUM at all. I genuinely hope this was your last bad encounter with our university. Most probably the employees at the center were stressed due to high workload currently, but this is of course no reason to yell at anybody, I would like to apologize to you once again.
Please keep me in the loop with any news and if you’ve spoken to Mrs. Schmidberger. Unfortunately, I can only play the messenger here and don’t make any decisions, and the above is the response I received back.
Best wishes and best of luck once again,

Hope you had a nice weekend!
Have you heard back from the lady? What was the issue about my documents? 🥲
I really think if there's any concern, they should at least name it so that I can work toward it.
BR,
[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]
[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]
[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],
Thank you for your comforting words and assurance. This means a lot to me.
The immediate enrolment is also crucial for me as I want to sign up for German language class (was already due on Monday) and other project classes from the TUM management school, as well as finding a student work position outside. Without the enrollment and the status as a student, the above is not possible since I can't access the class system and am not officially recognized as a student within Germany. I also need this to check up scholarship opportunities. Not to mention entry to the building, library and eating at Mensa etc etc.
I would appreciate to see the person come back to you with concrete concern and suggestion and we work to address it directly and asap.
I actually had a humiliating experience last Wed when I went to the Center of Study and Learning (I currently live 4 hours away from Munich) and asked if they received my university transcript. After queuing for 40 mins, the lady insisted they don't have my document given I presented her UPS tracking result and signature. The lady then went to the back office and retrieved my document folder and asked me where is your transcript VERY LOUD. I showed the proof of the signature and she again SHOUTED to me in front of the crowds that she doesn't know where it is, it's not in their office yet "WHERE IS YOUR TRANSCRIPT?". I later found the TUM mailroom and confirmed with the person who signed the signature, he showed me the TUM mailing system and confirmed they had already received it on 1st of Oct, yet the Center of Study and Learning didn't admit whether they lost it or it's still in the pile. I was really desperate since that transcript is the only one I have on hand. And now after almost another week and me following up by email and many calls, they convey through a 3rd person saying my transcript is not sufficient without giving a concrete answer.
Honestly I think this whole matriculation process with TUM has logical, resource allocation and operational issues. And it needs to be addressed to the school level. As I said, I have been through background checking many many times from INSEAD, Intel, Infineon, Microsoft and all of them had never had an issue with my documents. This can easily be escalated to law or PR issues if one of the students/candidates decided to go public for this frustrating experience.
Thank you.

I’m very sorry that the situation turned out to be so complicated and you have to deal with all of this, when you should have been able to start your studies without all of these worries. I totally understand your frustration at this point.
I have contacted a person at the matriculation office directly about your case a few days ago, if she could help me to clarify what exactly is missing in your case. I’m still waiting for a response, but I should hear back any day now.
I’ll suggest the following to you: I will ask if the solution you proposed to me just now would work for them. If yes, we will issue this statement ASAP, no problem. If no, I will find out what other solution they propose. I feel like there is some misunderstanding, since the documents you submitted for the application in the first place were marked as sufficient.
Long story short: I’ll try my best to resolve your problem with my colleagues at the matriculation office directly and as soon as possible. Please don’t worry, we will get this problem resolved.
While you are not matriculated, you can of course still attend your courses as normal. Please just make sure to connect with your classmates, so they can help you obtain the lecture materials while you do not have access to them online (due to not being enrolled officially). The course registrations are open until mid-November. Until then your matriculation issue should be resolved, and you’ll be able to register for the courses officially.
Again, I’d like to apologize to you on behalf of the university here. This is not how it’s supposed to go – please rest assured that we will get this resolved.
If you have more questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out to me.
Have a nice day and best wishes

[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],
I apologize for continuing to include you in this email thread, but the situation has become increasingly complex. As of now, the TUM Center for Study and Learning is still unable to explain why they are not allowing my enrollment, despite my submission of all required notarized documents on October 1st, which were based on my undergraduate degree and transcripts.
There's one issue where I may need your assistance. During the application process, I also submitted my INSEAD MBA degree and transcripts, although this is not a prerequisite for the TUM AI and Society master's program. I submitted all my degree documents without realizing I might need to have them all notarized. As a non-French citizen, it's extremely complicated to obtain notarized documents from an English-teaching school in France that meet German official requirements. If the ZAB (Statement of Comparability, Zeugnisbewertung) is not accepted by the TUM Center for Study and Learning, I will be left without a solution. Today, I contacted all relevant embassies (Taiwanese, French, and German) in Munich and Paris, but none could offer a solution to notarize an English-taught French school graduation certificate and transcripts.
I would like to inquire if you could help me obtain proof from the original AIS admission committee stating that my study place/admission was not contingent on my MBA degree. If we can present this document to the TUM Center for Study and Learning, it might facilitate my enrollment without further issues, as they are primarily concerned with verifying the documents on which my admission was based.

I hope you had a great weekend.
After several attempts trying to contact Student information in person and via phone calls, I have received confirmation that you have received my transcript but you still have questions regarding the document of my transcript. Here's the message I received from the system:
01.10.24 still not the Transcript of records submitted, confirmation of semester grades are not sufficient. Please submit a certified copy of your transcript of records which you have uploaded for the admission 30.09.24 We still need your Transcript of Records. We have only received confirmation that you have graduated and no overall grade has been given.
Can you please specify why the transcript was not accepted given it's the official and latest (Sep 2024) document from [REDACTED] University from Taiwan? And what solution do you recommend for me to have this issue addressed? I have also attached ZAB from Germany certified my degrees are correct and accepted by Germany official institutions (as attached).
To give you a few explanations that you might have questions regarding my transcript:
1. Version and format difference: I graduated in 2009, the digital version I uploaded was a transcript I got from my university in 2017. And since TUM required a paper version for matriculation, I have applied for a new one this year 2024 when I was in Taiwan earlier. There's a major change in how the paper texture, layout, format looks and that's why the digital and paper documents look very different.
2. Last semester taken abroad: I studied my last semester as an exchange student abroad, and the 2024 transcript version my university decided to change how it looks to show "grade not shown" as they don't accept foreign grades. It didn't impact my graduation requirement as I already fulfilled all the requirements before heading out for exchange and thus I still got my certificate of graduation in the same year.
3. I have already graduated from my undergraduate degree in 2009, worked for more than 10 years including Intel, Infineon and Microsoft as a full time employee and also got an INSEAD MBA in 2020. All of my later experiences had done the same for my university degree checking, some even went further to hire a 3rd party organization checking the authenticity of my degrees and I'd never encountered someone saying my transcript had an issue. Would you please tell me how you view my transcript different from what you need and what you propose to address it?
Thank you.

[REDACTED] information,
I hope you are doing well. I have received an attached message saying you couldn't find the transcript proof and hence still delayed my enrollment. Please note:
1. UPS tracking # 1Z8EG44TDK[NUMBER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]<[URLREDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] (received and signed by abdallah on 1st of Oct, 2024)
This document is the transcript document issued from my university in Sep, 2024 as the official proof of my grades qualified graduation and hence I've already got my undergraduate degree back in 2009.
2. The transcript document which I used to apply for AIS TUM was a document I got from 2017. For the reason TUM required a notary and stamped document, I went to my university this September and got an official copy, they have updated the format of the transcript as well as the paper used and that's why it looks slightly different from the one I uploaded during my application process.
3. I'm also attaching a certificate from Zentralstelle für ausländisches Bildungswesen which authenticated my educational background including my undergraduate from an official institute inside Germany.
Please proceed with my enrollment as soon as possible as this is impeding my rights to start my semester after tackling so many tasks to come this far.

All steps towards enrollment (postal delivery and processing) take time. Please act in a timely manner, so that you can be enrolled at the beginning of the semester. Please try to finish the steps for your enrollment as soon as you can, ideally so that you are already enrolled at the beginning of the semester. The last deadline for enrollment is 5 weeks after the lecture period begins.
Process for the digital health insurance notification (necessary before the enrollment):
[REDACTED] public health insurance providers can send a digital notification of your insurance status to TUM (even if you are insured otherwise).

Hi TUM student office,
I hope your day is great! I'm writing to ask for a verification of the deadline of student semester fees and tuition for international students. Inside my enrollment instruction there's a description mentioning 15th of Sep (see below) is the deadline but the actual invoice of both Semester fee and tuition mentioned 15th of Nov (see attachment). Can you help me to check on this one? I'm hoping it's the later one since my bank is still processing my student loan etc. Thank you.
Please transfer the Semester fees<https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx/wbStudienbeitragStatus.show?pSemesterNr=203&pStPersonNr=[NUMBER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]> by March 15th for the summer semester or until September 15th for the winter semester so that you can be enrolled before the semester begins. If you are an international student from a non-EU/EEA country, you also need to transfer the tuition fees for your degree program. Further information is available under: Semester fees<https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/pl/ui/$ctx/wbStudienbeitragStatus.show?pSemesterNr=203&pStPersonNr=[NUMBER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]>. Transferred fees will appear in your TUMonline tuition fee account within approx. 5 working days.

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY TO CARRY OUT THE NEXT STEPS!
[REDACTED]-[REDACTED],
Please be aware, admission is only the first step toward a successful start at TUM.
Log into your TUMonline applicant account to download your letter of admission and to carry out the next steps.
You will only be able to register for courses and begin your studies once you have officially enrolled (Immatrikulation). We recommend you do so before the semester begins.
To complete your enrollment, you must:
•       officially accept our offer of admission in TUMonline,
•       transfer the semester fee by the deadline, and
•       submit any missing documents, including the signed enrollment application, to the Admissions and [REDACTED] (Immatrikulationsamt) within the designated timeframe, i.e. your documents must be stamped received by TUM by the deadline.
After you have accepted your offer of admission, or “study place” in TUMonline, you need to provide any missing information in your account. Go to the “Enrollment” tab and click on the button “Add data”.
Fill out the form for adding any missing information and upload any required documents that have not yet been submitted. If you do not have the necessary documents at this time, you can upload them at a later date. For now, you can skip the upload step by clicking on the “Continue” button to end this step.
Once you click “Continue”, the link to the application for enrollment will be activated. (If you are not able to access the enrollment application, it means you have not completed the step above. Return to the “Add data” mask and click “Continue”.) You will also be given a list of all documents required for enrollment.
Some documents (e.g. passport-style photo or proof of health insurance) can be directly uploaded in TUMonline. Others must be sent in hardcopy by mail (e.g. the signed enrollment application, official transcripts and diplomas). The list will indicate which documents require certification.
You will need to print the enrollment application and send it as a signed hardcopy, together with any documents relevant for enrollment, by mail to TUM.
Once you have completed the above requirements, you will be enrolled automatically. You do not need to appear in person to enroll.
You will find detailed instructions on completing the enrollment process at: https://www.tum.de/studium/bewerbung/immatrikulation/
You will find all relevant deadlines at: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/application/application-info-portal/dates-periods-and-deadlines/
