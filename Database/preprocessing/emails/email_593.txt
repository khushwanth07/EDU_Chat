Betreff: [REDACTED]
[REDACTED],
My name is [REDACTED], and I am writing from Pakistan. I hold a Bachelor's degree in [REDACTED] from a Pakistani university, with a GPA of 57%.
I am interested in learning about the eligibility requirements for the M.Sc. AI in Society program. Could you please provide me with details about the program requirements?
I understand that applying through [REDACTED] can take 4-6 weeks, which may cause me to miss the application deadline. Would the program consider applications received after the deadline in this case?
Additionally, I would like to inquire if the program accepts the PTE academic test as proof of English language proficiency.
Finally, I would appreciate guidance on which programs I am eligible to apply for at your university. Does the tuition fee for a program affect the admissions difficulty?
Thank you for your time and consideration.
