Q: Can I list internships or work experience as a practical project?
A: Yes. In this case, please (additionally to the form) submit a work certificate in the field for practical projects, which states the duration as well as the content of your work. Since work certificates are not credit based, we will recalculate from work hours to credits (30 hours = 1 ECTS). https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/
