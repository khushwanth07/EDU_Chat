I have received the email, there is no need to worry. Until yesterday I was gone on a conference, which is why my responses are delayed.
We are setting up the test for September 3rd, and you will receive an email with all relevant information in time. Do not worry. There will be an online option, as well as an in-person option for taking the test.
Best wishes

[REDACTED]. Jayadeva,
I have just checked your application status online, and some documents are still not marked as “OK”.
I will need to speak to the matriculation office about this, and let you know afterwards what you need to do.
Since this is very last-minute, I cannot invite you to the test tomorrow, since the documents won’t be assessed this fast. However, we will be holding a third test date, to which I will gladly invite you should all your documents be sufficient in the end.
I apologize for the long wait.
