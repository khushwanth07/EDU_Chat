[REDACTED],
Thank you for your interest in the MSc. AI in Society.
Yes, you are free to submit multiple practical modules which in sum make up 18 ECTS. The wording is a bit confusing, leading people to think that we require one single project worth 18 credits – we will rephrase that.
If you have more questions, feel free to reach back out.

Betreff: Question regarding requirements for Masters
[REDACTED]/[REDACTED],
I would like to apply for the master’s Degree in AI in Society. In the requirements for this major however, it is mentioned that applicants should have completed a practical project worth at least 18 credits during their bachelor’s studies (Mensch-Computer-[REDACTED] Würzburg). In my bachelor’s degree, there is not a single module that is worth more than 12 ECTS Credits. Would I still be eligible for this program if the sum of my completed modules would meet the required 18 credit points?
Thank you very much!
Yours
