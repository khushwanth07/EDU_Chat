the practical project does not exclusively need to be from your bachelorâ€™s studies. In fact, we also count work experience or internships, for example. Please also refer to the FAQ question on our website: https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/
For us, it is important that there is some sort of proof of your project, i.e. that we can see that you did not just invent it. For example, a statement from your employer, or a certificate of participation in any external projects.
Best wishes

Hello,
I am writing to inquire about the admission requirements for the AI in Society - MSc course. Specifically, I would like to know if it is necessary to submit a project work worth 18 credits at the bachelor's level. My university did not offer the option to complete such a project.
Additionally, I would like to know if it is possible to submit independent or other project work that I have completed for other parties.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
