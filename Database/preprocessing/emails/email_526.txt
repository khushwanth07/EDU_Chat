Betreff: Question regarding [REDACTED]: Ai in Society
[REDACTED]. [MANUALL_REDACTED],
I recently stumbled upon the new Master's Program TUM is launching next semester, AI in Society. I couldn't think of a more fitting master's program to match my interests. Currently, I am wondering if I fulfill all the application requirements. I finished last year with a Bachelor's in Business, Economics and [REDACTED] (BESC) at WU Vienna.
For the 18 ECTS concerning the practical part of the requirements, I have done the following:
  *   Bachelor's Thesis in English: 8 ECTS
  *   Project Course in [REDACTED] and Innovation together with Fraunhofer, including final report: 4 ECTS
  *   Project Course in [REDACTED] and Innovation together with RHI Magnesita, including final report: 4 ECTS
  *   Project Course in [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] together with Mayr-[REDACTED] AG: 8 ECTS
Based on my bachelor's degree, do you also think I would be a good fit for the program? Please find my CV and University transcript attached. I would highly appreciate any feedback or information on whom else I can contact regarding this.
Thank you for your time!
