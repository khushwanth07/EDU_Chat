Body:
[REDACTED],
Thank you for your email and interest in the program AI in Society.
If your thesis spans 15 ECTS and fits well into the field of technology applied to social sciences, then we highly encourage you to apply anyways! I am sure you have taken another practical course during your bachelor’s studies that would provide the missing 3 ECTS – please list them all in the application process (even if they do not fit the required theme perfectly).
As a heads up: there will be separate forms to fill in this information in a more organized manner soon. I would kindly ask you to check back inside the application platform in around a week and apply with the provided forms.
If you have any more questions, don’t hesitate to reach back out.

Betreff: Interests on the new degree program: AI in society
[REDACTED]. [MANUALL_REDACTED],
my name is [REDACTED], and I am studying informatics B.Sc. at TU Munich. Recently I noticed that School of [REDACTED] and Technology is offering a new study program, AI in society. While I took a look at the admission requirements, it says a practical project of at least 18 ECTS was required.
Since the bachelor program of TUM Informatik only offers thesis of 15 credits, does this mean I will not be qualified, even if the content of the thesis project is qualified for the application?
Best,
[REDACTED]
