Thank you for your email.
Since the coming semester is the very first semester we are offering this program, we do not have data on graduate outcomes yet. So, unfortunately I cannot give you information on this.
Best,

Betreff: MSc AI in Society - [REDACTED]
Hello,
I recently discovered your program for AI in Society, it seems like a relevant & compelling program. The program description lists the type of jobs that this program is geared towards but do you have any relevant data on actual graduate outcomes? Iâ€™m specifically interested in data points such as:
  *   Hiring firms
  *   Average/Median starting salary (self reported)
  *   Countries graduates are hired in
If your program tracks this data or anything similar please let me know. Thank you for your time!
Best,
[REDACTED]
