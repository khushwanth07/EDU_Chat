There seems to have been a technical mistake. We will try our best to add you to the moodle exam today and send you the link to participate tomorrow.
Should anything go wrong, there will be a third test date, as well, to which we will invite you. But letâ€™s try the test date tomorrow.
We apologize for the confusion.
Best,

Hello, I received a mail from Alina stating that I am eligible for TUM AI in [REDACTED] held on 16/07/2024 and that I will receive the platform link as well as payment link few days before. But till this date I have received no such thing, please have a look in this matter.
