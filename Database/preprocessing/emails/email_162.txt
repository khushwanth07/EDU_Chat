[REDACTED] from AI in Society,
I am writing regarding the requirements and tuition fee for this program. I am a non-European second-semester student of the MSc Politics and Technology specializing in Data and Society. I would like to pursue a second Master of AI in Society.
In the practical project, is the practical project from my current master's program also taken into account? That is because I don't think the practical project from my previous Bachelor's can meet the requirements of having both engineering or scientific knowledge and social science. In my current practical project at TUM, I am working specifically on AI ethics and believe it is satisfactory to apply for this program.
Since this will be my second master's program, I am not sure if I will have to pay the tuition fee or not. I have tried to look it up on the TUM website, but it does not mention it. Therefore, is it possible for me to ask for more information on this?
I am looking forward to your response.
