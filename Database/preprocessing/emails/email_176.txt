Due to changes in current circumstances, I would like to inform you that, if there is still a chance for me to attend the second stage of the application process, I would like to rescind my application withdrawal.
Previously, I was hospitalised and had to undergone surgery, not only that, due to financial circumstances I felt that it would be best that I don‘t proceed. However, today I had just received an offer to further study at TUM from [REDACTED] relAI scholarship if I get an admission.
I would like to apologise for the inconvenience I have caused.
I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your understanding in this matter and also your time.

In case you do not agree to partake in the online test with the automated monitoring procedure, please note that the only other option we can offer you is to take the test in person.
