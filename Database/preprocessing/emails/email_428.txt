So, does it mean that I don't have the test tomorrow?

Due to the large number of applications, there are still applicants which we didn’t fully check yet. Your application is unfortunately not fully checked yet (they also weren’t processed first-come-first-serve). For these cases, we are planning a second test date on July 16th, to which you will be invited, should your documents pass.
We apologize for the delay and hope for your understanding.
Best wishes

I have applied to the Master 3 months ago, but I still didn't get the confirmation for the test tomorrow.
Should I expect it at any time today?
*Sorry for bothering you now, I imagine you have much stuff to do.
Thanks.
