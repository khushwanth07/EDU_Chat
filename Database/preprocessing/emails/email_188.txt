Unfortunately, we won‚Äôt be able to move the test to August, since most people will be on vacation from our side. Therefore, we won‚Äôt be able to conduct the test then already. If it helps, we are planning the test on the 2nd or 3rd of September. So, not mid/end of the month.
Best wishes

[REDACTED]'am,
One small humble request if you don't mind-
Is it possible to keep the test in August month
Because I am an international student and my visa process might take around 1 month and the classes starts in October.
 I am really passionate about this program and I feel  this is the only program which property aligns with my passion and I really really want to get into this program.
Please consider it as a  very sincere and humble request from my side.
Thanking you with utmost humbleness

[MANUALLY REDACTED] application status online, and some documents are still not marked as ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.
I will need to speak to the matriculation office about this, and let you know afterwards what you need to do.
Since this is very last-minute, I cannot invite you to the test tomorrow, since the documents won‚Äôt be assessed this fast. However, we will be holding a third test date, to which I will gladly invite you should all your documents be sufficient in the end.
I apologize for the long wait.
