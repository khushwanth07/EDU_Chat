[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],
[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] and I have been admitted to the Master of Science (M.Sc.) program in "AI in Society." I have a couple of questions:
  1.  Where will the main classes for this program be held?
  2.  When do the lectures officially start? I couldn't find this information on the website.
I would appreciate it if you could provide me with these details.
Thank you in advance for your assistance.
