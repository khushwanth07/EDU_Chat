Betreff: Questions about English proficiency certificate in special case
[REDACTED] or Madam,
I am applying for the master's program in “AI in Society.”.
Due to my double degree bachelor program, I studied in the UK for the last year.
I obtained 60 ECTS in the transcript, including the bachelor's thesis.
And I have also been awarded a UK bachelor's degree.
So in this case, may I be free of an English proficiency certificate?
