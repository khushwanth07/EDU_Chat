Yes, if there is not enough space, you can duplicate the form (if I understand the problem correctly).

I hope this email finds you well.
There is one more question: if I filled all the tables of the
document, but it didn't reach the requirement of 140 ECT in total, Can
I duplicate the table and add courses to let the total number of
credits of all courses listed reach 140 ECT?
Really thank you for your assistance!

It will affect your application only in a good way: we're asking for this sorting, because we only consider your best grades for calculating your admission score. This form is essentially just some help for us to see right away, which of your modules are your best, without manually sorting through your Transcript of Records.
