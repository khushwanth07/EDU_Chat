Thank you for your interest in our study program. Of course we can discuss your questions.
Before I make suggestions: would you be able to come in person, or do you prefer a zoom meeting?
Best wishes

I hope you are doing well. My name is [REDACTED], and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in [REDACTED]. I am very interested in applying to the "AI in Society" Master program, as it aligns with my academic goals. However, I am struggling to understand the admission requirements, and if my courses would be recognised. Given your expertise and your role, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss the program in more detail with you. Please let me know if you might be available for a brief conversation face to face at your convenience. Thank you so much and I hope to hear from you soon.
