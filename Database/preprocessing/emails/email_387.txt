I have already understood this but thank you for additional clarification. Moreover, I have asked whether you can tell me how many questions will there be in the exam.
Thank you in advance.

Dear applicants,
as a short clarification: please choose the option about off-site or on-site on the moodle exam page, not via an email to me. Please look for "Select your exam option here".
Thank you!
Best,
