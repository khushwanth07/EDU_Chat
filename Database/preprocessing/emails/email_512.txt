Betreff: Could not reupload document
Hello,
My information is as follows:
Applicant number
2-[MANUALLY REDACTED]
Application number
1-[MANUALLY REDACTED]
Degree programme
Master of Science | AI in Society (1. FS)
Start of course
Winter semester 2024/25
I have submitted my application. However, I wanted to update my "Subject and grade transcript of studies to date" section but I accidentally uploaded the wrong file. I immediately tried to re-upload the correct file but it timed out. So I clicked "Upload document" for that section again, the wrong file was uploaded instead.
I've been trying for many hours trying to re-upload the correct file but it won't let me. The page either times out or is stuck loading the page.
Could you advise what I should do? In the meantime, I'll still try to re-upload it.
Apologies for the trouble, but I attach here the file I wanted to re-upload in case I couldn't upload the correct file by the deadline.
Warm regards,
[REDACTED]
