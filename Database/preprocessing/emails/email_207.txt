There is no such thing as an official date/extension when you need to be here. As far as I am concerned, the courses of the first semester will be streamed online, allowing you to participate while you’re not yet in Munich.
In the week before the semester starts, we will have a one-week block course on programming. This one, I do not yet know if it will be streamed online in parallel. However, since I can imagine that you’re not the only person with this problem, I will try and ask if we can make all first-semester courses streamable online.
I hope this helps.
Best,
