[REDACTED],
Congratulations again on the admission! We are happy to welcome you here in October.
Regarding your questions:
- Campuses: we will be holding our lectures in the center of the city, mainly. The buildings will be: Richard-Wagner-Str. 1, Marsstr. 20-22, and Arcisstr. 21.
- Regarding specific networking events for our study program, there is currently unfortunately nothing particular I could offer. However, rest assured that you will meet all your fellow classmates, since you all have the same study plan and visit the same courses. There will be plenty opportunity to connect. ðŸ˜Š
Best wishes

[REDACTED],
I hope this message finds you well. My name is [REDACTED], and I am excited to introduce myself as a newly enrolled student in the Al in Society master's program at TUM. I am truly grateful for this opportunity and look forward to engaging deeply with the course content and contributing to the academic community.
I wanted to inform you that I have successfully completed my enrollment and have submitted all required documents. Initially, there was a mix-up with my documents, which reached the non-affidavit section, but I have since resent the correct affidavited documents. I trust that this will resolve the matter.
As I prepare for the upcoming semester, I would like to strengthen our professional relationship and ensure a smooth start to my studies. I am particularly interested in understanding the logistics regarding class locations. Could you kindly inform me about the campuses where the classes for the Al in Society program will be held? Additionally, I would like to know if I will need to attend lectures on different campuses, and if so, could you please provide the names of these campuses? This information will be very helpful as I plan to find accommodation nearby.
Furthermore, I have been trying to find networking opportunities with fellow students in the same course but have not been successful online. Are there any specific networking options, groups, or events organised for students of the Al in Society program?
Once my enrolment is fully processed, l will reach out again to discuss course registration and any other preparatory steps. Thank you very much for your time and support. I am looking forward to your response and to beginning this exciting journey at TUM.
