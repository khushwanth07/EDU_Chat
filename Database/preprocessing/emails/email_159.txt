[REDACTED]. Shivacharam,
Unfortunately, we cannot contact the embassy in this matter. However, if you will be in Munich physically a bit later, it should be no problem since we will be offering the first semester lectures online, as well (since there are a few people facing similar problems as you). This way, you will not miss any content.
Best wishes

Hello AIS team,
I hope this email finds you well.
I am [REDACTED], and I am excited to have received an admission offer for the MSc AI in Society program for the upcoming winter semester. However, I am currently facing difficulties securing a visa appointment at the German consulate in India.
Would it be possible for the university to assist by writing to the German consulate or embassy on my behalf? Additionally, I would appreciate any guidance on what steps I should take if I receive my visa later than expected.
Thank you for your support.
