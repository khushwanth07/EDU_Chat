j) Examination Parcours:
In an examination parcours, multiple examination elements are completed as part of a single assessment.
Unlike module component examinations, the parcours is conducted in a cohesive organizational (spatial and temporal) format.
The examination elements collectively capture the full competency profile of the module.
Examination elements may include formats such as presentations and oral examinations in combination with practical work.
The total examination duration is specified in the module catalog.
