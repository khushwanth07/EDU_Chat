g) Presentation:
A presentation is a systematic, structured, visually supported oral delivery (using tools such as projectors, slides, posters, videos) that illustrates and summarizes specific topics or results, distilling complex matters to their core.
The presentation should demonstrate the ability to research and present a specific topic within a given time in a clear, concise, and understandable manner to an audience.
It should also show the ability to respond competently to audience questions, suggestions, or discussion points.
The presentation may be supplemented by a brief written preparation.
