i) Learning Portfolio:
A learning portfolio is a collection of selected works, based on predefined criteria, to demonstrate learning progress and achievement at a given point in time concerning defined content.
The selection of works, their relevance to personal learning progress, and their significance for achieving learning outcomes must be justified.
The portfolio should demonstrate responsibility for the learning process.
Depending on the module description, components of a successful learning portfolio may include application-related work, websites, weblogs, bibliographies, analyses, thesis papers, and graphical representations of a topic or question.
A summary discussion may be conducted to reflect on the portfolio verbally.
