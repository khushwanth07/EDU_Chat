6. Documentation
The procedure of the qualification process must be documented, including the names of the individuals involved in the decision, the evaluation of both the first and second stages, and the overall result.
A protocol must be created for the test, which should include the external details of the event (date, location, start and end of the test, names of the selection committee members present, names of the applicants, and any special occurrences).
The same applies to the qualification interview, with an additional summary of the key topics discussed.
