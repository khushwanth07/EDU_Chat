b) Laboratory Work:
Depending on the discipline, laboratory work includes experiments, measurements, fieldwork, field exercises, etc., aimed at conducting, evaluating, and gaining insights.
Components may include describing procedures and their theoretical foundations (including literature review), preparation and practical execution, necessary calculations, documentation and evaluation, and interpretation of results in terms of the knowledge gained.
Laboratory work may be supplemented by a presentation to assess communication skills in presenting scientific topics to an audience.
