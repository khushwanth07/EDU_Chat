(1) Current Starting Point: As Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve and becomes 
increasingly integrated into every aspect of our lives, it brings forth a variety of challenges 
and problems across technological, economic, and political domains. These challenges 
stem from the rapid development and widespread adoption of AI technologies, as well as 
their potential consequences on society.


		further information about challenges :
		Challenges associated with the increasing adoption of AI-based solutions in society:
		1)User-related 2)Socio-economic  3)Socio & geo-political:Regulation and governance: 


		1)User-related:Bias and fairness: AI algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate existing biases in 
data, leading to unfair and discriminatory outcomes.
Explainability and interpretability: Many AI models are considered "black boxes" 
due to their complex and hard-to-understand decision-making processes, hence 
user-dependent explanations and trust-building measures are needed.
Security and privacy: The increasing reliance on AI raises concerns about 
privacy, security, and potential misuse (detecting fake news, protecting the end 
user, etc.)

		2)Socio-economic:Job displacement: The automation of tasks by AI may lead to job displacement 
in various industries, potentially exacerbating unemployment and income 
inequality.
Digital divide: The unequal access to AI technologies and the skills required to 
use them can widen the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged 
populations.
Economic concentration: The dominance of a few large tech companies in AI 
development can lead to an unhealthy concentration of power and stifle 
innovation.

		3)Socio & geo-political:Regulation and governance: The rapid development of AI calls for effective 
regulation and governance to ensure responsible and ethical use, but the pace 
of technological advancement often outstrips the ability of policymakers to 
respond.
Geopolitical competition: The race for AI supremacy among nations raises 
concerns about national security, surveillance, and the weaponization of AI.
Social & Ethical considerations: The deployment of AI in various sectors raises 
ethical questions about the appropriate boundaries and limits of AI applications.



(2) Addressing the above-mentioned and multifaceted challenges posed by AI's rapid 
development requires a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach involving various 
stakeholders. For example, mitigating bias and improving explainability in AI requires a 
blend of technical advancements and diversity among development teams. Tackling socioeconomic issues such as job displacement and the digital divide necessitates cooperative 
efforts in reskilling, education, and improved technological access. Creating effective AI 
governance involves legal experts, ethicists, and policymakers working together to establish 
international norms and regulatory frameworks. In essence, a collaborative and cross-disciplinary approach is crucial to responsibly steer the development and implementation of 
AI technologies.


(3) Aim and Contribution of the MSc program “AI in Society”: The MSc program addresses 
the above challenges posed by the integration of AI into society by equipping the students
with technical skills and interdisciplinary knowledge. The program focuses on mitigating 
biases in AI, enhancing user-dependent explainability and interpretability, ensuring data 
privacy and security. It also emphasizes the importance of equitable access to AI 
technologies and fostering a competitive AI ecosystem. By exposing students to legal, 
ethical, and policy aspects of AI, the program prepares them to shape regulations and 
governance frameworks, assess potential risks, and contribute to responsible, ethical, and 
inclusive AI applications. Especially the current developments in AI (e.g., in the realm of 
generative AI for generating texts, speech, images, and videos) call for an interdisciplinary 
oversight supported by social scientists who understand the workings, limitations, and 
potential impact of such AI solutions.


(4) The intended role of graduates from the MSc program "AI & Society" is to serve as AI 
ethicists, consultants, researchers, or product managers in various fields, as well as AI 
policy advisors in public administration. Their job is to ensure the responsible development 
and implementation of AI technologies, analyze their potential societal impacts, and promote 
ethical AI practices in both private and public sectors. Graduates will contribute to the 
design, evaluation, and governance of AI systems that prioritize fairness, transparency, and 
social good, while fostering innovation and inclusivity across diverse domains. In summary, 
the program is an interdisciplinary approach that aims to equip students with the tools and 
concepts they need to successfully apply AI in social contexts for the social good.
The role of the graduates from the MSc program "AI & Society" is not to primarily work in 
the field of AI development, as that is typically done by graduates with a pure computer 
science back-ground. Instead, these graduates, equipped with a profound understanding of 
AI, take on intermediary or interface functions between the technical and social science 
aspects of AI applications.


(5) The MSc program "AI in Society" is both research-oriented and application-oriented. 
It is research-oriented as it involves the study of complex AI-related challenges, including 
biases, socio-economic implications, and legal and ethical aspects. It is application-oriented 
as it prepares graduates for roles such as AI ethicists, consultants, researchers, and policy 
advisors, where they apply their knowledge to ensure responsible and ethical AI practices 
in real-world settings. Thus, the program integrates theoretical knowledge and practical 
skills to address AI's societal impact.
