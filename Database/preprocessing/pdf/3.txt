Given the focus of the envisioned Master's program "AI in Society," the most relevant study 
programs from the above list, both in Germany and abroad, that align closely with the themes of AI, 
society, ethics, and public policy are:
In Germany:
• Master in Artificial Intelligence for Public Services (AI4GOV) at Universidad Politécnica 
de Madrid (Spain), Politecnico di Milano (Italy), Friedrich-Alexander-Universität 
Erlangen-Nürnberg (Germany), and the Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech). This 
program is particularly relevant because it focuses on the application of AI in public 
services, bridging the gap between technology and governance.
• Data Science for Public Policy at Hertie School of Governance. This program 
emphasizes the intersection of data science with public policy, making it highly relevant 
for understanding the societal implications of AI.
• Social and Economic Data Science at Universität Konstanz. This program delves into 
the societal and economic implications of data, which can be closely related to the 
broader themes of AI in society.
• Applied Business Data Science at the International School of Management. While it has 
a business focus, the integration of data science can offer insights into the commercial 
and societal impacts of AI.
Abroad (Europe):
• AI Ethics and Society at the University of Cambridge, UK. As the name suggests, this 
program is directly aligned with the ethical and societal considerations of AI, making it 
one of the most relevant programs on the list.
• AI and Digital Society at Radboud University. This program explores the broader 
implications of AI in the digital realm, touching upon societal impacts.
• Media, Data and Society at the University of Liverpool, UK. This program delves into the 
media's role in the age of data, offering insights into how AI impacts communication and 
society at large.
• Social Data Science at the University of Oxford. This program's focus on understanding 
societal trends and behaviors through data aligns closely with the themes of AI in 
society.
• Data Science and Society at Tilburg University, NL. With tracks in health, governance, 
media, and business, this program offers a comprehensive look at the various societal 
domains impacted by AI.



The "AI in Society" program stands out due to its interdisciplinary approach, comprehensive 
curriculum, emphasis on societal implications, and flexible structure. It caters to a diverse target 
group and offers a unique blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application, all under the 
guidance of renowned experts in the field. More specifically, main USP of the MSc Programm “AI in 
Society” are the following:
• Interdisciplinary Approach: While many programs focus either on the technical aspects 
of AI or its societal implications, "AI in Society" seamlessly integrates both. It provides 
students with a holistic understanding, bridging the gap between technology and its real world impact.
• Comprehensive Curriculum: The program covers a wide range of topics, from 
foundational AI and data science to the governance, law, and regulation of AI. This 
breadth ensures that graduates are well-equipped to navigate the multifaceted 
challenges posed by AI in various societal contexts.
• Focus on Societal Implications: Unlike many AI programs that prioritize commercial or 
industrial applications, "AI in Society" emphasizes the broader societal, ethical, and 
political implications of AI. This makes it particularly relevant in today's world, where the 
societal impact of technology is a topic of global concern.
• Diverse Target Group and a rich, interdisciplinary learning environment where different 
perspectives converge.
• Flexible Program Structure: With a mix of compulsory and elective modules, students 
have the flexibility to tailor their learning experience. They can delve deeper into areas 
of personal interest while still gaining a comprehensive understanding of the core 
themes.
• Practical Application: The inclusion of hands-on modules like "Project Week" ensures 
that students don't just gain theoretical knowledge but also practical skills. This balance 
prepares them for real-world challenges in both academic and professional settings.
• Global Perspective: While the program is rooted in the context of AI's impact on society, 
its curriculum draws on global examples and case studies. This international outlook 
prepares students to navigate the global challenges and opportunities posed by AI. 
The introduction of the "AI in Society" program at TUM is not just a response to current academic 
and industry trends but a strategic move to reinforce TUM's position as a leading global institution, 
committed to excellence, innovation, and societal betterment.



(2)Internal Competition Analysis
Distinction from the MSc programs “Computer Science” and “ Politics & Technology” 
While the "Politics and Technology" program emphasizes the broader relationship between all forms 
of technology and political structures, "AI in Society" narrows down to the specific challenges and 
opportunities presented by AI. The "Computer Science" program, even with SOT electives, remains 
fundamentally a technical degree, preparing students for roles that primarily involve software 
development, algorithm design, etc. In contrast, "AI in Society" prepares students for roles that 
require a nuanced understanding of AI's societal implications.
In summary, the AI & Society graduates are equipped to address the complex challenges that arise 
at the intersection of AI and society. Their ability to evaluate AI systems' societal impacts, navigate 
ethical considerations, and influence policy and regulation make them valuable assets in a rapidly 
evolving AI landscape.
