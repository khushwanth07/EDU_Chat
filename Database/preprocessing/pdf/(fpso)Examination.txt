The specific components of each module examination and the competencies to be assessed are detailed in the module description. Examinations may be conducted as individual or group examinations, provided the topic is suitable. § 18(2) sentences 2 and 3 of the APSO apply accordingly.

a) Written Examination:
A written examination is a supervised written test aimed at identifying problems within a limited time using the provided methods and tools and, if necessary, applying solutions.
The duration of written examinations is regulated in § 12(7) of the APSO.
b) Laboratory Work:
Depending on the discipline, laboratory work includes experiments, measurements, fieldwork, field exercises, etc., aimed at conducting, evaluating, and gaining insights.
Components may include describing procedures and their theoretical foundations (including literature review), preparation and practical execution, necessary calculations, documentation and evaluation, and interpretation of results in terms of the knowledge gained.
Laboratory work may be supplemented by a presentation to assess communication skills in presenting scientific topics to an audience.
c) Exercise Task:
Exercise tasks involve solving predefined problems (e.g., mathematical problems, programming tasks, modeling, designs, etc.) to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problem-solving.
They serve to verify factual and detailed knowledge and its application.
Exercise tasks can be conducted in written, oral, or electronic form, such as homework, worksheets, programming exercises, (e-)tests, design tasks, posters, tasks within university internships, attestations, etc.

d) Report:
A report is a written summary and reflection of a learning process aimed at structuring and presenting learned material and analyzing results in the context of a module.
The report should demonstrate that key aspects have been understood and can be effectively communicated in writing.
Possible report types include excursion reports, internship reports, and work reports.
The written report may be supplemented by a presentation to assess communication skills in delivering the content to an audience.
e) Project Work:
Project work involves several phases (e.g., initiation, problem definition, role distribution, idea generation, criteria development, decision-making, execution, presentation, written evaluation) to achieve a defined goal within a specific timeframe using appropriate tools.
It may include a presentation or technical discussion to assess communication skills in presenting scientific topics to an audience.
Project work can also encompass design drafts, drawings, plans, models, objects, simulations, and documentation.
f) Scientific Paper:
A scientific paper is a written assignment where a complex scientific or scientifically applied question is independently addressed using the scientific methods of the respective discipline.
It should demonstrate the ability to fully address a module-related question, from analysis to conception to implementation, in compliance with scientific standards.
Possible formats include thesis papers, abstracts, essays, term papers, seminar papers, etc., varying in complexity.
A scientific paper may be accompanied by a presentation and, if necessary, a colloquium to assess communication skills in presenting scientific topics to an audience.


g) Presentation:
A presentation is a systematic, structured, visually supported oral delivery (using tools such as projectors, slides, posters, videos) that illustrates and summarizes specific topics or results, distilling complex matters to their core.
The presentation should demonstrate the ability to research and present a specific topic within a given time in a clear, concise, and understandable manner to an audience.
It should also show the ability to respond competently to audience questions, suggestions, or discussion points.
The presentation may be supplemented by a brief written preparation.
h) Oral Examination:
An oral examination is a time-limited dialogue on specific topics and questions to be answered.
It aims to demonstrate understanding of the subject matter and the ability to place specific questions within the broader context of the field.
The duration of oral examinations is regulated in § 13(2) of the APSO.
i) Learning Portfolio:
A learning portfolio is a collection of selected works, based on predefined criteria, to demonstrate learning progress and achievement at a given point in time concerning defined content.
The selection of works, their relevance to personal learning progress, and their significance for achieving learning outcomes must be justified.
The portfolio should demonstrate responsibility for the learning process.
Depending on the module description, components of a successful learning portfolio may include application-related work, websites, weblogs, bibliographies, analyses, thesis papers, and graphical representations of a topic or question.
A summary discussion may be conducted to reflect on the portfolio verbally.
j) Examination Parcours:
In an examination parcours, multiple examination elements are completed as part of a single assessment.
Unlike module component examinations, the parcours is conducted in a cohesive organizational (spatial and temporal) format.
The examination elements collectively capture the full competency profile of the module.
Examination elements may include formats such as presentations and oral examinations in combination with practical work.
The total examination duration is specified in the module catalog.

(2) Module examinations are generally conducted alongside the program. The type and duration of each module examination are listed in Appendix 1. Deviations from these specifications must comply with § 12(8) of the APSO. The evaluation of module examinations is governed by § 17 of the APSO.
