The program uses a variety of teaching and learning methods to cater to different learning styles and 
ensure a comprehensive understanding of the material. More specifically, traditional lectures form 
the backbone of the curriculum, providing students with foundational knowledge in areas like AI, 
deep learning, and natural language processing. Interactive seminars in courses such as 
"Explainable AI -- A Comprehensive Seminar on Transparent and Ethical AI‚Äù employ seminar-style 
teaching, fostering discussions and debates on the explainable and ethical AI. Through hands-on 
workshops in courses like "Deep Learning Demystified: Hands-on Deep Learning for Non-CS 
Majors" a practical, workshop-based approach is envisioned, where students can actively engage 
with the material and gain hands-on experience. On the other hand, research projects, such as the
Project Weeks, where students come together to address real-world problems through AI in an 
interdisciplinary team, offers students an opportunity to undertake hands-on interdisciplinary 
research projects, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge and creative AI solutions to practical 
challenges (see also: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/key-skill-programs/project-weeks).
