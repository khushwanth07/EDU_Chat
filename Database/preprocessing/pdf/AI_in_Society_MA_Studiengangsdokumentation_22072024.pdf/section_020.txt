Internal Competition Analysis
Distinction from the MSc programs “Computer Science” and “ Politics & Technology” 
While the "Politics and Technology" program emphasizes the broader relationship between all forms 
of technology and political structures, "AI in Society" narrows down to the specific challenges and 
opportunities presented by AI. The "Computer Science" program, even with SOT electives, remains 
fundamentally a technical degree, preparing students for roles that primarily involve software 
development, algorithm design, etc. In contrast, "AI in Society" prepares students for roles that 
require a nuanced understanding of AI's societal implications.
In summary, the AI & Society graduates are equipped to address the complex challenges that arise 
at the intersection of AI and society. Their ability to evaluate AI systems' societal impacts, navigate 
ethical considerations, and influence policy and regulation make them valuable assets in a rapidly 
evolving AI landscape.
