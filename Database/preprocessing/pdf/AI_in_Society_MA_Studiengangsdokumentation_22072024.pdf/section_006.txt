the Aim and Contribution of the MSc program “AI in Society”: 
A:The MSc program addresses 
the above challenges posed by the integration of AI into society by equipping the students
with technical skills and interdisciplinary knowledge. The program focuses on mitigating 
biases in AI, enhancing user-dependent explainability and interpretability, ensuring data 
privacy and security. It also emphasizes the importance of equitable access to AI 
technologies and fostering a competitive AI ecosystem. By exposing students to legal, 
ethical, and policy aspects of AI, the program prepares them to shape regulations and 
governance frameworks, assess potential risks, and contribute to responsible, ethical, and 
inclusive AI applications. Especially the current developments in AI (e.g., in the realm of 
generative AI for generating texts, speech, images, and videos) call for an interdisciplinary 
oversight supported by social scientists who understand the workings, limitations, and 
potential impact of such AI solutions.
