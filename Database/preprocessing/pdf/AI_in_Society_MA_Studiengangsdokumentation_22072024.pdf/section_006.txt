Q:What is the intended role of graduates from the MSc program "AI & Society" 
A: It is to serve as AI 
ethicists, consultants, researchers, or product managers in various fields, as well as AI 
policy advisors in public administration. Their job is to ensure the responsible development 
and implementation of AI technologies, analyze their potential societal impacts, and promote 
ethical AI practices in both private and public sectors. Graduates will contribute to the 
design, evaluation, and governance of AI systems that prioritize fairness, transparency, and 
social good, while fostering innovation and inclusivity across diverse domains. In summary, 
the program is an interdisciplinary approach that aims to equip students with the tools and 
concepts they need to successfully apply AI in social contexts for the social good.
The role of the graduates from the MSc program "AI & Society" is not to primarily work in 
the field of AI development, as that is typically done by graduates with a pure computer 
science back-ground. Instead, these graduates, equipped with a profound understanding of 
AI, take on intermediary or interface functions between the technical and social science 
aspects of AI applications.
