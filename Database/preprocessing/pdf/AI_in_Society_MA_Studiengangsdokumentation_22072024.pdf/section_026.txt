2. Deepening Knowledge and Skills: The next set of courses, including Deep Learning, 
Explainable AI, Social Science Methods for Studying AI in Society (Academic Competencies
and Practical Skills and Methods 1), and AI in Diverse Societies, as described in Table 1 are 
designed to deepen the students' knowledge and understanding, forming the basis for the 
development and/or application of independent ideas. These courses also start to introduce 
the application of knowledge, with students expected to integrate existing and new 
knowledge in complex contexts, make scientifically sound decisions, and carry out 
application-oriented projects.
