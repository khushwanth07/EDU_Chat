the Demand Analysis of Degree programm
A:
Employment possibilities: Graduates from the “AI in Society” program will find themselves at a 
pivotal juncture in the job market. As AI continues to weave itself into the fabric of our society, there's 
an escalating demand for professionals who can seamlessly merge the intricacies of technical AI 
with the nuances of social requirements and desired benefits. This program is meticulously designed 
to prime graduates for a plethora of roles across diverse industries and sectors.
In the technology sector, graduates might find roles in designing user-friendly AI interfaces and 
human-AI interaction processes or in ensuring that AI algorithms are transparent and ethically sound. 
In healthcare, they could be instrumental in integrating AI into diagnostic processes, patient care, 
and medical research, ensuring that the technology respects patient rights, privacy, and delivers 
equitable care. For instance, they might work on teams developing AI-driven diagnostic tools, 
ensuring that these tools are not only technically robust but also ethically designed and considerate
of diverse patient populations.
In education, graduates could guide the development of AI-driven educational tools, ensuring they 
cater to diverse learning needs while maintaining ethical standards. In the realm of sustainability, 
they might work on AI solutions for environmental monitoring or sustainable resource management, 
ensuring that these solutions are both effective and socially responsible.
For those venturing into public administration, they could be at the forefront of crafting policies that 
govern AI use in public services, ensuring that they are equitable and in the individual’s and public's 
best interest. In consulting, graduates might advise businesses on the ethical implementation of AI, 
while in research, they could delve deep into the societal implications of AI, guiding future 
innovations.
Specific job roles that encapsulate these responsibilities include AI ethicists, who ensure that AI 
applications uphold moral and ethical standards; policy advisors, who guide governmental and 
organizational AI strategies; interdisciplinary researchers, who explore the multifaceted impacts of 
AI on society; and AI strategy consultants, who aid businesses in leveraging AI responsibly and 
effectively

Actual demand and relevant data: The demand for professionals who possess a blend of expertise 
in AI and social sciences is surging. Given Germany's position as a leading global economy and its 
rapid digital transformation, there is a growing demand for professionals who understand both the 
technical and societal facets of AI. A fitting example of the high regional, but also global demand can 
be seen in the strong interest (in the establishment of this program) and endorsement by the
companies participating in the advisory board (i.e., extended QM circle) of this program: the 
European Central Bank, Continental, Porsche, IBM, and Adobe. These companies see a distinct 
advantage – and have formally expressed their interest through letters of intent – in hiring graduates 
with interdisciplinary AI competence, who can bridge the gap between social and technical 
challenges related to AI applications. Moreover, with growing concerns about AI ethics, privacy, and 
governance both corporations and governmental bodies are increasingly aware of the imperative to 
address the societal ramifications of AI. This has amplified the need for specialists who can 
seamlessly navigate the social and practical intricacies of AI. Such professionals not only bring 
conceptual and technical AI expertise but also a nuanced understanding of how AI impacts societal 
structures in different domains and norms. This dual expertise ensures that AI implementations are 
not just practical and technically sound but also socially responsible and beneficial for the individual 
and the society as a whole.
The McKinsey report underscores this trend, indicating that from 2016 to 2030, the demand for social 
competencies will increase at double the rate of other skills, witnessing an 8 to 9 percent growth in 
demand per decade. [https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/skill-shift-automation-and-the-future-of-the-workforce] This trajectory implies that the goal of our program is 
not just to produce social scientists proficient in AI concepts and principles but to cultivate 
professionals who can leverage AI to enhance research and applications across disciplines like 
psychology, sociology, economics, and political science, and law.
