The Master program “AI in Society” covers a wide range of topics from the technical aspects of AI 
and data science to the societal implications of AI. The curriculum includes foundational courses in 
AI and data science, programming and data processing, as well as specialized courses on topics 
such as deep learning, human-AI interaction, and natural language processing. It also includes 
courses that focus on the societal aspects of AI, such as governance, law and regulation of AI, AI in 
diverse societies, and elective modules in different societal application areas of AI. In this way the 
program prepares students for roles bridging technical AI and societal implications. It provides 
interdisciplinary knowledge and the grounding for responsible and interdisciplinary application of AI.

The significant number of mandatory courses stems from the recognition that students enter the 
program with diverse backgrounds outside of computer science. It is essential to first equip them 
with fundamental AI concepts, rudimentary programming skills, and computational aspects of social 
science methodologies to effectively address the challenges posed by AI applications across various 
societal sectors. By grounding students in these foundational topics, we ensure they possess the 
comprehensive skill set required to quantify, navigate and innovate within the complex landscape of 
AI integration into social science research, developments, and processes. This holistic approach not 
only bridges any pre-existing knowledge gaps but also fosters a collaborative learning environment 
where students from various disciplines can contribute unique perspectives.

The program culminates in a Master's thesis, allowing students to apply the knowledge and skills 
they have acquired throughout the program to a research project.
