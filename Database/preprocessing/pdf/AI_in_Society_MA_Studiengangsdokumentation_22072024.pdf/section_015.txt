project spanning typically 18 credits, where engineering or scientific insights are blended with 
political or social science perspectives to address societal issues, especially within technologicallydriven contexts. (5) Successful clearance of an aptitude test. To pass the aptitude test expertise in 
the fundamentals of mathematics and statistics, engineering and natural sciences, political and 
social sciences, and economics and law is required, also with regard to their practical application at 
the interface of engineering and natural sciences with political and social sciences.
