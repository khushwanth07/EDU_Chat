3) Mobility window: During the third semester, students have the opportunity for a mobility window, 
allowing for a typical one-semester study period at another university either within Germany or 
internationally, without any time delay in their academic progression. The respective modules
(Human-AI Interaction, Natural Language Processing, Project week and two elective modules) can 
be substituted with comparable courses from other universities. Periods of study will be recognized 
unless there are substantial differences in the competences acquired.
