Module Code :SOT10046
Compulsory Module Name:Human-AI Interaction
Aim & contribution to the qualification profile:
This module delves into the intricacies of user experience 
and human factors in AI systems, which are pivotal for the 
successful integration and adoption of AI technologies in 
daily applications (e.g., recommendation engines, search 
algorithms, decision support systems, generative AI 
solutions, etc). Through literature reviews and group 
discussions, students will collaboratively design and 
develop AI-integrated interactive systems. Hence, 
graduates will be equipped with the expertise to critically 
assess the performance of AI-driven interactive systems, 
ensuring they can bridge the gap between AI technology 
and its practical, user-centric applications.
