3. Specialization and Application: The final set of courses, including Natural Language 
Processing, Human-AI Interaction, and Project week (see Table 1), allow students to 
specialize in their areas of interest and apply their knowledge and skills to real-world 
scenarios. These courses are designed to further enhance the students' ability to design 
research questions, choose and justify concrete ways of operationalizing research, select 
and justify research methods, and explain and critically interpret research results.
