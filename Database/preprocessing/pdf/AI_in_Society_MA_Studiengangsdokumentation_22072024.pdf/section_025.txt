1. Foundation and Introduction: The program begins with foundational courses in AI, Data 
Science, Introduction to Programming & Data Processing, AI in and for Society: Science, 
Technology and Society in the Digital Age, as well as courses on Law, Governance, & 
Regulation of AI, and an introduction to Psychology of learning and instructional design of 
AI-based systems. These foundation and introductory courses in the M.Sc. program "AI in 
Society" aim to equip students with a foundational understanding of AI, data science, 
programming, and the societal implications of AI. Recognizing the diverse academic 
backgrounds of incoming students, these compulsory courses ensure a consistent and 
unified knowledge base across AI concepts, programming, and the societal aspects of AI. 
This approach fosters a shared terminological foundation, enabling students from various 
disciplines to engage effectively throughout the program. These foundational courses are 
compulsory to guarantee that all students, regardless of their previous bachelor-level 
academic backgrounds, attain a consistent understanding of essential subjects and foster a 
unified terminological foundation in AI concepts, programming, regulation and politics of AI.
