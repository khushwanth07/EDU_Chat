The significant number of mandatory courses stems from the recognition that students enter the 
program with diverse backgrounds outside of computer science. It is essential to first equip them 
with fundamental AI concepts, rudimentary programming skills, and computational aspects of social 
science methodologies to effectively address the challenges posed by AI applications across various 
societal sectors. By grounding students in these foundational topics, we ensure they possess the 
comprehensive skill set required to quantify, navigate and innovate within the complex landscape of 
AI integration into social science research, developments, and processes. This holistic approach not 
only bridges any pre-existing knowledge gaps but also fosters a collaborative learning environment 
where students from various disciplines can contribute unique perspectives.
