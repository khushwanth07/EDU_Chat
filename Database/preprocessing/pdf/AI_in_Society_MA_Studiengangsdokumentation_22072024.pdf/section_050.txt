Module Code :SOT10059
Compulsory Module Name: Development of 
Research Instruments
Aim & contribution to the qualification profile:
This module equips students with the expertise to design theory-based 
questionnaires tailored for instructional measurement. They'll master 
the evaluation of existing instruments using psychometric quality 
criteria, conduct studies to assess these criteria, and refine 
instruments based on findings. This ensures students can (re-)use, 
create and critically assess research tools, enhancing the validity and 
reliability of their research.
