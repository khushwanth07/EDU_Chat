Given the focus of the envisioned Master's program "AI in Society," the most relevant study 
programs from the above list, both in Germany and abroad, that align closely with the themes of AI, 
society, ethics, and public policy are:
In Germany:

de Madrid (Spain), Politecnico di Milano (Italy), Friedrich-Alexander-Universität 
Erlangen-Nürnberg (Germany), and the Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech). This 
program is particularly relevant because it focuses on the application of AI in public 
services, bridging the gap between technology and governance.
