Q:What is the Knowledge and Understanding of Qualification Profile:
A:Graduates will possess an enriched comprehension of AI. This means they will not only be 
acquainted with the general terminologies, governance, and principles of AI but also with technical 
concepts like neural networks, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning. They will understand 
the boundaries of AI, such as its limitations in understanding human emotions or the challenges in 
ensuring unbiased algorithms, fairness, and transparency. They will also be well-versed in its 
applications, ranging from healthcare diagnostics to autonomous vehicles, and the societal 
implications these applications bring, like job displacement or privacy concerns.
In addition, graduates will have a comprehensive, and critical grasp of areas at the forefront of AI. 
For instance, they will be knowledgeable about areas like generative AI, natural language 
processing, or reinforcement learning. Equipped with this knowledge, they will be trained to convey 
and discuss pioneering ideas with technical and non-technical experts, be it for practical applications,
for research or public discourse. This also encompasses an understanding of the ethical dilemmas 
AI poses, such as surveillance concerns or decision-making biases, the legal frameworks 
surrounding AI use, and the broader social implications. They will be familiar with strategies to 
address AI-related challenges, like implementing fairness checks or ensuring transparency and 
privacy in AI decision-making processes. In this way, they will be able to bridge ethical, regulatory
and practical requirements in various AI application domains. 
Furthermore, graduates will be adept at understanding the quality-related challenges of AI 
applications, taking into account both scientific and methodological factors. For example, they will 
be familiar with different evaluation strategies for assessing the appropriateness of a machine 
learning model for a given dataset or the potential pitfalls. They will possess the skills to tackle both 
practical and theoretical issues using these considerations. This will also involve a deep 
understanding of the principles of responsible AI for ensuring data privacy and security, and methods 
to gauge the societal repercussions of AI, like engagement with relevant stakeholders and 
conducting impact assessments or community consultations.
