curriculum, emphasis on societal implications, and flexible structure. It caters to a diverse target 
group and offers a unique blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application, all under the 
guidance of renowned experts in the field. More specifically, main USP of the MSc Programm “AI in 
Society” are the following:

foundational AI and data science to the governance, law, and regulation of AI. This 
breadth ensures that graduates are well-equipped to navigate the multifaceted 
challenges posed by AI in various societal contexts.
• Focus on Societal Implications: Unlike many AI programs that prioritize commercial or 
industrial applications, "AI in Society" emphasizes the broader societal, ethical, and 
political implications of AI. This makes it particularly relevant in today's world, where the 
societal impact of technology is a topic of global concern.
• Diverse Target Group and a rich, interdisciplinary learning environment where different 
perspectives converge.
• Flexible Program Structure: With a mix of compulsory and elective modules, students 
have the flexibility to tailor their learning experience. They can delve deeper into areas 
of personal interest while still gaining a comprehensive understanding of the core

that students don't just gain theoretical knowledge but also practical skills. This balance 
prepares them for real-world challenges in both academic and professional settings.
• Global Perspective: While the program is rooted in the context of AI's impact on society, 
its curriculum draws on global examples and case studies. This international outlook 
prepares students to navigate the global challenges and opportunities posed by AI.
