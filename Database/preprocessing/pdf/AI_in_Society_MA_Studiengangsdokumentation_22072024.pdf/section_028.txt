In summary, this blend of traditional lectures, interactive sessions, hands-on workshops, group work, 
and research projects ensures a comprehensive and immersive learning experience for students, 
preparing them for both academic and industry challenges in the realm of AI.


Interdisciplinary competencies, such as a sense of social responsibility and personality development, 
are integrated throughout the program. For example, the course on AI in Diverse Societies 
encourages students to consider the social implications of AI and the importance of ethical decision-making in this field. The project work also provides opportunities for students to develop their 
teamwork and communication skills, as well as their ability to work independently and take 
responsibility for their own learning.
