the backbone of the curriculum, providing students with foundational knowledge in areas like AI, 
deep learning, and natural language processing. Interactive seminars in courses such as 
"Explainable AI -- A Comprehensive Seminar on Transparent and Ethical AI” employ seminar-style 
teaching, fostering discussions and debates on the explainable and ethical AI. Through hands-on 
workshops in courses like "Deep Learning Demystified: Hands-on Deep Learning for Non-CS 
Majors" a practical, workshop-based approach is envisioned, where students can actively engage 
with the material and gain hands-on experience. On the other hand, research projects, such as the
Project Weeks, where students come together to address real-world problems through AI in an 
interdisciplinary team, offers students an opportunity to undertake hands-on interdisciplinary 
research projects, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge and creative AI solutions to practical 
challenges (see also: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/key-skill-programs/projectweeks).

In courses such as the "Academic Competencies and Practical Skills" student will learn academic 
and hands-on skills, from design thinking to academic writing through targeted sessions. Students 
will apply and reflect on these skills considering the latest developments in AI and its societal 
integration. Collaborative courses and projects ensure furthermore throughout the accompanying 
exercises of the curriculum that students develop teamwork skills and learn to collaborate on 
complex AI challenges.


In summary, this blend of traditional lectures, interactive sessions, hands-on workshops, group work, 
and research projects ensures a comprehensive and immersive learning experience for students, 
preparing them for both academic and industry challenges in the realm of AI.


Interdisciplinary competencies, such as a sense of social responsibility and personality development, 
are integrated throughout the program. For example, the course on AI in Diverse Societies 
encourages students to consider the social implications of AI and the importance of ethical decisionmaking in this field. The project work also provides opportunities for students to develop their 
teamwork and communication skills, as well as their ability to work independently and take 
responsibility for their own learning.


(3) Mobility window: During the third semester, students have the opportunity for a mobility window, 
allowing for a typical one-semester study period at another university either within Germany or 
internationally, without any time delay in their academic progression. The respective modules
(Human-AI Interaction, Natural Language Processing, Project week and two elective modules) can 
be substituted with comparable courses from other universities. Periods of study will be recognized 
unless there are substantial differences in the competences acquired.
