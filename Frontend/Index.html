Privacy policy
Data protection is an important concern for the Technical University of Munich. We want you to know when we store which data and how we use it. Personal data is collected on this central web server of the University (www.tum.de) only to the extent technically necessary. Data processing is subject to the applicable data protection regulations, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Bavarian Data Protection Act (BayDSG) and the Digital Services Act (DDG).
                            
In the following, we inform you about the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data. This information can be accessed at any time from our website.
                            
Technical implementation
The web servers of the Technical University of Munich are operated by the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) operated.
                            
Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ)
Boltzmannstraße 1
85748 Garching b. Munich
                            
Logging
When you access this or other websites, you transmit data to our web server via your Internet browser. The following data is temporarily recorded in a log file during an ongoing connection for communication between your internet browser and our web server:
                            
IP address of the requesting computer
Date and time of access
Name, URL, and amount of data transferred of the retrieved file
Access status (requested file transferred, not found, etc.)
Identification data of the browser and operating system used (if transmitted by the requesting web browser
Website from which the access was made (if transmitted by the requesting web browser)
The processing of the data in this log file is carried out as follows:
                            
The log entries are continuously evaluated automatically in order to detect attacks on the web servers and to be able to react accordingly.                            
In individual cases, i.e. in the case of reported faults, errors and security incidents, a manual analysis is carried out.
Log entries that are older than seven days are anonymized by shortening the IP address.
The anonymized logs are used to create access statistics. The software used for this is operated locally by the LRZ.
The IP addresses contained in the log entries are not merged with other databases by the LRZ, so that it is not possible for the LRZ to draw conclusions about individual persons.
                            
Active Components
Active components such as JavaScript, Java applets or Active X controls are used in this website. This function can be switched off by you by setting your internet browser.
                            
Google Maps
This website uses the "Google Maps and Route Planner" function of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google") to display and calculate geographical information and access routes. Google Maps can transmit data about your use of this website to Google, collect it and use it by Google. You can prevent such data transfer by deactivating "Javascript" in your browser. In this case, however, no maps can be displayed. By using this website and not deactivating "Javascript", you agree that you agree to the processing of your data by Google for the above purpose. For more information about how Google Maps and the route planner use your data, as well as Google's privacy policy, please visit: https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps/

This website also uses the BayernAtlas to display aerial photos and building views. This service is provided by the State Office for Digitization, Broadband and Surveying, Alexandrastraße 4, 80538 Munich, postal address: P.O. Box 22 14 28, 80504 Munich.

Cookies
In order to expand the range of functions of our website and to make it more convenient for you to use, we sometimes use so-called "cookies". With the help of these cookies, data can be stored on your computer when you visit our website. However, you can deactivate the storage of cookies or set your browser so that cookies are only stored for the duration of the respective connection to the Internet. However, this could limit the range of functions of our offer.
                            
Online forms
Personal data that you may send to us via contact forms, registration forms and similar websites on our web servers will only be accepted with your consent and serve exclusively the purpose stated in the forms. Please note the relevant information on the forms.
                            
In all forms, only the personal data that is absolutely necessary is collected. Usually, the personal data is stored in a database of the Leibnitz Computer Center and is accessible to the responsible TUM employees. If the purpose of the data collection is to make the data accessible to other members of TUM, the principle of data economy is observed. Your data will not be passed on to third parties, unless this is explicitly stated in the form.
                            
Your personal data will be deleted after the purpose has been fulfilled, unless you have given your consent to further contact.
                            
You can revoke your consent at any time for the future. To do so, please contact it-support@tum.de. Your data will then be deleted immediately.
                            
Electronic mail (e-mail)
Information that you send to us unencrypted by electronic mail (e-mail) may be read by third parties in transit. As a rule, we cannot verify your identity and do not know who is behind an e-mail address. Legally compliant communication by simple e-mail is therefore not guaranteed. Like many e-mail providers, we use filters against unsolicited advertising ("SPAM filters"), which in rare cases also incorrectly classify normal e-mails as unwanted advertising and delete them. E-mails that contain harmful programs ("viruses") will be automatically deleted by us in any case.
                            
Use of Facebook Social Plugins
Our website uses social plugins ("plugins") of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The plugins are marked with a Facebook logo or the addition "Facebook Social Plugin".
                            
When you call up a website on our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection with Facebook's servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser and integrated into the website by it.
                            
By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to your Facebook account, even if you have not confirmed the "Like" button. When you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking the "Like" button or making a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted directly from your browser to Facebook and stored there.
                            
Even if you don't have a Facebook account, Facebook can collect data about you, such as your IP address. For the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy, please refer to the Privacy Policy from Facebook.
                            
If you do not want Facebook to collect data about you via our website, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website. In addition, you can also install appropriate blockers for your browser through add-ons.
                            
Use of Twitter
On our homepage you will find functions of the provider Twitter. These are offered by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. By using Twitter and the "Re-Tweet" function, the websites you visit are linked to your Twitter account and made known to other users. In the process, data is also transmitted to Twitter.
                            
We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the pages, have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by Twitter. Further information on this can be found in Twitter's privacy policy at https://twitter.com/privacy.
                            
Use of YouTube plugins (videos)
Our website contains plugins from www.youtube.com which is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").
                            
If you call up pages of our website provided with such a plug-in, a connection to the YouTube servers will be established and the plug-in will be displayed on the website by means of a message to your browser. This transmits to the YouTube server which of our websites you have visited. If you are logged in as a member of Youtube, YouTube assigns this information to your personal user accounts of these platforms. When using these plugins, such as clicking/starting a video or sending a comment, this information is assigned to your YouTube user account, which you can only prevent by logging out before using the plugin. Further information on the collection and use of data by the platform or plugins can be found in Youtube's privacy policy under the following link: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.
                            
We use embedded YouTube videos in advanced privacy mode. This means that YouTube does not store cookies for a user who views a web page with an embedded YouTube video player, but does not click on the video to start playback.
                            
Use of Vimeo plugins (videos)
Plugins from the video portal Vimeo of Vimeo, LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011, USA are integrated into our website. Every time you visit a page that offers one or more Vimeo video clips, a direct connection is established between your browser and a Vimeo server in the USA. Information about your visit and your IP address will be stored there. Through interactions with the Vimeo plugins (e.g. clicking the start button), this information is also transmitted to Vimeo and stored there.
                            
If you have a Vimeo account and do not want Vimeo to collect data about you through this website and link it to your member data stored by Vimeo, you must log out of Vimeo before visiting this website.
                            
The privacy policy for Vimeo with more information on the collection and use of your data by Vimeo can be found at https://vimeo.com/privacy.

This website uses the web service of Issuu, Inc., 131 Lytton Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301, USA. Issuu uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to an Issuu server in the USA and stored there.

Two clicks for more data protection
Only by clicking on a social network button does it become active and your browser establishes a direct connection with the respective servers. The first click on the button therefore means that you give your consent to the transmission of data to the relevant provider.
                            
By activating the button, the user receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged in to the respective social network, the visit can be assigned to your account from that moment on, even if you do not confirm the button a second time. If you interact with the plugins, for example by making a comment by pressing the button again, the corresponding information will be transmitted from your browser directly to the provider and stored there.
