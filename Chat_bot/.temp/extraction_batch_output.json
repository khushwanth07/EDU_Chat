In Part 2, applicants take a written aptitude test, where they can earn up to 48 additional points. These two scores are summed up to determine the total score, which then dictates the admission outcome: •Direct Admission: Applicants scoring 68 points or more are immediately admitted.•Rejection: Applicants scoring under 40 points in total and less than 18 points from Part 1 are directly rejected.•Interview Round: If an applicant scores 48 points or more, but does not reach the 68 - point threshold, they are invited for an interview.•Rejection After Interview: If the total score is under 48 points, the applicant is rejected. This structured evaluation ensures a fair selection process by considering both academic performance and aptitude test results while providing a second chance through the interview for borderline cases.",

        "question": "What happens if the points scored in the test and from degree grades do not pass the thresholds?",
        "answer": " If the points scored from the degree grades (Part 1) and the written aptitude test (Part 2) do not meet the required thresholds, the outcome depends on the total score: 1. Immediate Rejection: o If the total score is below 40 points and the applicant has scored less than 18 points from Part 1, they are immediately rejected. 2. Interview Opportunity: o If the total score is between 40 and 67 points but is still at least 48 points or more, the applicant is invited for an interview. - The interview serves as an additional evaluation step to determine if the applicant can still qualify for admission. 3. Rejection After Interview: o If the applicant’ s total score is below 48 points, even if they qualify for an interview based on their score distribution,they are rejected without further evaluation. In summary, failing to pass the minimum thresholds can lead to either an immediate rejection or an invitation to an interview, depending on the exact score distribution.",

        "answer": " For the M.Sc. AI in Society program at TUM, the admission process is based on a scoring system that evaluates applicants through two parts: academic performance (grades from degree program) and a written aptitude test. The total score determines whether an applicant is admitted, invited for an interview, or rejected. Score Thresholds for Admission Decisions: 1. Direct Admission: o Applicants with a total score of 68 points or more are admitted directly to the program. 2. Interview Requirement: o Applicants who score 48 points or more but less than 68 points are invited for an interview. o The interview serves as an additional assessment to determine the applicant 's suitability for the program. 3. Rejection: o Immediate Rejection: If the applicant 's total score is below 40 points and they have less than 18 points from Part 1 (academic grades), they are automatically rejected. o Rejection After Interview: If the total score is below 48 points, the applicant is rejected without an interview.",
