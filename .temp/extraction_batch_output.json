        "question": "Can I apply for the M.Sc. AI in Society at TUM if my bachelor's degree did not include a thesis or credit-bearing project, but I have relevant work experience?",
        "answer": "You can prove your practical expertise through work experience as well, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a university course. You might have, for example, worked at a company during your studies, where you were working on projects relevant to our study field. This experience also counts, but you will need to submit suitable proof for this (e.g. in the form of a certificate of employment). For reference, 18 ECTS credits correspond to a workload of 540 hours. If you submit such proof of practical experience (which was not part of your degree program), it needs to indicate how much time you spent on it, and have it correspond to our 18 ECTS requirement. It also has to be clear to us what exactly you were working on.",
