If it does not show up on your transcript, we cannot count it!\n  2.  It is not necessary to submit English certificates, if instead you can prove your knowledge to us by “English as language of instruction” during your Bachelor’s studies, or if your thesis was written in English.

I am reaching out to request additional information regarding the admission requirements for the AI in Society master’s program (starting from October). Specifically, I would like to understand if I meet the necessary criteria based on my academic and professional background.\nHere is a brief overview of my profile:\n•  I am a Czech student currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in [REDACTED] at VŠEM University in Prague, which I am set to complete in January 2025.\n•  My GPA, converted to the German grading system, is 1.5.\n•  As part of the Erasmus+ program, I spent 4 months at TH Köln, studying in the Code & Context program.\n•  I have completed two internships at Forvia, an automotive company, in the digitalization department (one in Germany, one in the [REDACTED]), and I am currently engaged in a third internship with the same company in the [REDACTED].\n•  I have successfully completed a B2 English course at my home university and an A1.2 course at TH Köln, both with the highest possible grades.\nI am particularly seeking clarification on the following:\n1.      Regarding the practical project, would the Bachelor thesis be sufficient as I am writing about Industry 4.0 and its implementation?\n2.      Is it necessary to submit an English proficiency certificate such as TOEFL or IELTS, or would my completed English and German courses be sufficient for this requirement?\n3.      Are there any other specific admission criteria I should be aware of or additional steps I might need to take?\nThank you very much for your time and consideration.

AI in Society.\nI’m very sorry to read what has happened to you – this sounds beyond frustrating. Thank you for explaining your situation in detail.\nNow: in German universities, there is a notion of “endgültig nicht bestanden”, i.e. “finally/definitively failed”. This means, if you have finally failed a subject and you have therefore failed your degree, you are exempted from doing the same/similar degree anywhere else in Germany. I am assuming that you received an “endgültig nicht bestanden”.\nTherefore, the first step here would be to check whether your degree (MSc. [REDACTED]) and our degree (MSc. AI in Society) are similar enough (“fachverwandt”). This check needs to be done by our program heads, but for this we need to know more details about your previous degree, i.e. which university, which modules are part of the curriculum, etc.\nAfter we have done this check, there are two ways this could go:\n1) Either we decide that the two degrees are not similar enough; then you can apply to us with no problems. Or:\n2) We decide that the two degrees are highly similar; then you, unfortunately, would be declined by TUM.\nTherefore, please let us know some more information about your previous degree. You can also just send us the website of the degree if it lists all relevant information.\nBest wishes, happy holidays, and a happy new year,\n[REDACTED]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about my eligibility to apply for the AI in Society program at TUM.\nFirstly, I am an international student who came to Germany for my masters study, after finishing my bachelors in my home country. During my previous studies in MSc [REDACTED] at a German public university, I encountered an unfortunate situation that resulted in my exmatriculation. The project in question was entirely my own work, but it was uploaded to GitHub without my consent by a co-worker from the company where I was completing my internship, whom I had trusted for a second opinion. This individual later admitted to uploading the project as an act of personal retaliation after I declined their romantic advances a week later.\nDespite providing evidence to support my case (including transcripts, correspondence, and screenshots), the incident was ultimately classified as academic misconduct, and I was exmatriculated. This situation was devastating, as I was just 5 credit points away from completing my master's degree, having successfully passed all other exams (many with excellent grades), completed my internship, and already secured a master's thesis placement. I had successfully completed numerous challenging exams in technical subjects, all of which were on paper where cheating was not an option and never even crossed my mind. I am truly perplexed as to how my previous university could not see that this was simply a misunderstanding.\nI am passionate about completing my education and am eager to continue contributing to this field. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss whether my application would still be considered in light of these circumstances.The circumstances are deeply regrettable, and measures have been taken to ensure such a situation cannot happen again.\nCould you please advise whether this situation would impact my application to your program? I would be happy to provide further information or documentation if necessary.\nThank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your response.\n"}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

I have a few questions regarding qualifications for the program.\nIn my degree program, we had a Bachelor’s [REDACTED] (10 ECTS) and a Bachelor’s Thesis  (12 ECTS). My practical course involved building an app to measure and manage the sustainability of business processes, which aligns well with the program's requirements for practical projects in my opinion. Since 18 ECTS are needed for the practical project, I would appreciate your advice on whether the following bachelor thesis project satisfies the criteria or if I should consider an alternative solution.\nFor my bachelor’s thesis, I am working on implementing a GenAI app prototype for the [REDACTED] Department at Mercedes-Benz. The app aims to automate the retrieval of information from various sources by evaluating data structuring methods specific to [REDACTED] cases. This project is designed to significantly reduce costs and open new possibilities within the [REDACTED] domain. Could you please share your opinion on whether this project meets the criteria for admission and I can add that? Do you think the focus is appropriately aligned with the program's expectations, or should it be adjusted?\nAdditionally, regarding the aptitude test, could you provide more insight into the assessment of political and social sciences? While my background is predominantly technical, I have been deeply interested in social and political sciences since high school. I am confident I would enjoy studying these topics and perform well in this program.\nI am familiar with current global political and social topics. However, if the assessment includes topics like business law or other specialized areas, I would like to prepare accordingly. Could you provide detailed guidance on the structure and focus of the assessment & aptitude test procedure?\nThank you very much for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you.\n"}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

It would therefore be a requirement for you to earn at least 2 more credits by the time of your application at TUM (such that they are officially visible on your transcript of records). Keep in mind that applications are open until May 31st, so possibly you can collect 2 more credits by then.\n  2.  If you have taken courses with heavy coursework, this could count as practical experience (depending on the contents, of course). In general, we also recognize practical projects outside of university, for example in the form of work experience. The important thing to us here is, that you can somehow prove this.

I believe my academic background aligns well with the program, particularly in terms of the computational courses and practical experience in software development. My GPA is more than 9, which reflects my consistent academic performance. Additionally, I have attached my Medium of Instruction (MOI) letter  and my LAST SEMESTER MARKSHEET from SRM University, confirming that my degree is conducted in English and the truth of the statement , which meets the language requirements as per TUM’s guidelines.\nRegarding the credit requirements, I understand that TUM asks for 140 credits, while my current credit tally stands at 138. I would like to mention that my degree curriculum and academic courses are closely aligned with the areas TUM focuses on, particularly in computer science. However, I am currently short of 2 credits, and I would appreciate clarification on whether there are any ways I can address this shortfall or if a waiver would be possible, given my academic alignment with the program.\nAdditionally, I understand that TUM requests details of relevant projects for the application. While I have not yet completed formal projects, I have gained practical experience through my coursework and contributions to open-source software development. I am eager to undertake relevant projects to strengthen my application and am open to discussing any alternatives that could meet the project requirements.\nI would be grateful for your consideration of my situation and would appreciate any guidance or support regarding the credit discrepancy and project requirements. If possible, I kindly request a waiver or suggestions on how I can proceed with the application process.\nThank you for your time and consideration.

I am writing to inquire about my eligibility to apply for the AI in Society program at TUM.\nFirstly, I am an international student who came to Germany for my masters study, after finishing my bachelors in my home country. During my previous studies in MSc [REDACTED] at a German public university, I encountered an unfortunate situation that resulted in my exmatriculation. The project in question was entirely my own work, but it was uploaded to GitHub without my consent by a co-worker from the company where I was completing my internship, whom I had trusted for a second opinion. This individual later admitted to uploading the project as an act of personal retaliation after I declined their romantic advances a week later.\nDespite providing evidence to support my case (including transcripts, correspondence, and screenshots), the incident was ultimately classified as academic misconduct, and I was exmatriculated. This situation was devastating, as I was just 5 credit points away from completing my master's degree, having successfully passed all other exams (many with excellent grades), completed my internship, and already secured a master's thesis placement. I had successfully completed numerous challenging exams in technical subjects, all of which were on paper where cheating was not an option and never even crossed my mind. I am truly perplexed as to how my previous university could not see that this was simply a misunderstanding.\nI am passionate about completing my education and am eager to continue contributing to this field. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss whether my application would still be considered in light of these circumstances.The circumstances are deeply regrettable, and measures have been taken to ensure such a situation cannot happen again.\nCould you please advise whether this situation would impact my application to your program? I would be happy to provide further information or documentation if necessary.\nThank you for your understanding, and I look forward to your response.\n"}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

This way, you will understand the basics of nonparametric inference and how to apply it in practice.\nUsing real-world examples from experimental or observational data, we will gain experience by applying these methods to uncover causal relationships and draw robust conclusions. Crucially, we will engage in hands-on projects where you can put your coding skills to the test.\nEvaluation:\nThe final grade is entirely based on an oral exam.

My application was rejected, because with my Bachelor's degree I did not fit into the requirements.\nMy goal is to try to fill these \"gaps\" during this year and send the application again next year.\nHowever, as I already mentioned, no one really helped me.\nMy doubts are about:\n- the 5 credits about statistics/mathematics and\n- \"a practical project spanning typically 18 credits, where engineering or scientific insights are blended with political or social science perspectives to address societal issues, especially within technologicallydriven contexts.\"\nFor how the statistics exam is concerned, I am going to do an exam at the LMU.\nThe subject matter is a curse called: \"[REDACTED]: Hands-on with bootstrap and [REDACTED]\"\nContent:\nIn this course, we will learn how to conduct empirical analyses through the lenses of permutation- and bootstrap-based techniques. In particular, we will uncover how these nonparametric methods allow us to make reliable inferences under minimal assumptions in a data-driven way.\nThis course offers a unique blend of three domains: a solid theoretical foundation, a careful treatment of the computational principles, and a comprehensive revision of key applications that are essential for causal inference. This way, you will understand the basics of nonparametric inference and how to apply it in practice.\nUsing real-world examples from experimental or observational data, we will gain experience by applying these methods to uncover causal relationships and draw robust conclusions. Crucially, we will engage in hands-on projects where you can put your coding skills to the test.\nEvaluation:\nThe final grade is entirely based on an oral exam. You will be evaluated based on the three core principles of the course, that is\n1.    Applying basic mathematical tools on paper or whiteboard based on the material we covered in class.\n2.    Analyzing a real-world problem using the tools we covered in class. This will entail understanding the statistical environment, the basic assumptions underlying the resampling method one can apply, and the computational challenges or limitations of the method.\n3.    Interpreting the empirical results and having a rigorous discussion about it.\nCan this course be considered as valid, right?\nCould it even be valid to partially cover the requirement about the 18 ECTS practical project?\nIf not, I really do not understand what this practical project means. How could I \"gain\" these credits? Which kind of exams would fit?\nI am very confused and not even having support from the university itself has already been quite stressful and overwhelming, especially for a student like me, who is ready to do anything to reach her goals.\nThank you in advance for your time.\n"}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

To answer your questions:\n  1.  Here, the requirement is that you have at least 140 completed credits at the point of your application. If this holds, this is sufficient. Grade-wise, I cannot tell you if this will get you to admission: if you look at our procedure graphic here<https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/>, you will see that the grade only makes up one part of the point calculation. The other part is made up of the aptitude test, which you will need to take with us.\n  2.  We don’t require applicants to provide one single project worth 18 credits, you can also specify multiple ones which in sum make up 18 credits (see also here<https://www.sot.tum.de/sot/studium/ai-in-society/application/> in the FAQ section at the bottom). However, regarding your thesis: keep in mind that we can only count your thesis as a project module if it will be completed at the point of your application (i.e. the 15 ECTS are officially part of your transcript at that point).\nBest wishes\n[REDACTED]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED].[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] and I am currently studying at HAW Hamburg, B.[REDACTED] engineering and is in my last semester.\nI am very interested in the Masters program of AI in Society at TU Munich and would be applying for the coming winter semester 2025.\nI have couple of questions:\n1. My grade during my degree 2,2 and still have to submit my [REDACTED] of on the Topic of Hydroponics, thesis is worth 15 credit points and thus can improve the overall grade substantially, so eventual grade would be around 1,9/2,0 (in a normal case scenario), the whole degree is worth 210 credit points. My question is, is it sufficient to get into the program (i.e. suffices minimum requirement).\n2. There is requirement on the page of the program where a project is needed to be worth at least 18 credit points, but during my degree according to the \"Studiumsplan\", i don't have a project worth that much, 1 compulsory project worth 10 credit points, 1 elective project worth 5 credit points and the previously mentioned thesis worth 15 credit points. How can I satisfy this requirement?\nHope to hear from you, that would be greatly helpful.\nRegards,\n[REDACTED]\n"}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

Essentially, these are topics to help you study machine learning and data science, which will already be taught from the first semester onwards (see “Foundations of AI & [REDACTED]”). If there are possibilities for you to still study such courses at your university, I would take the chance.\nAs for the project: what you are describing might be a bit insufficient, regarding the technical aspect. I can, unfortunately, not tell you for sure right now, since it is up to our selection committee to decide in the end, but I still encourage you to apply and describe your projects as best as possible (there will be forms to fill out for this inside the application portal).

I would appreciate your insights!\nAll the best,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nI really appreciate your elaborate response! Ok \nAbout the project; the reason I asked about the specific quantitative requirements is because I intent on using my BA thesis as ‘proof’ of my practical project. The focus of my thesis is on the growing importance of industry-experts in global AI governance, and will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods. However, I will only be able to submit the thesis project for my application in May next year, hence the question about the best time(s) to apply for the program. Will everyone receive their admission results at the same time? Another option would be to submit my minor thesis (15 ECTS) which was a case-study (including quant. thematic analysis) on China’s growing role within the UN, supplemented by my work as an analyst where I’ve worked on a project focusing on the future challenges of Western democracy (e.g. the role of emerging technologies). However I don’t have any hard-proof of having used statistical methods). Maybe you can tell me what my best option is here.\nSorry for the long e-mail; I appreciate your response ik advance!\nBest,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nThank you for your interest in our study program. Of course, I’m happy to answer your questions:\n  1.  Your course “Research and Methods” would pass as sufficient, if you also provide us a description of what has been taught in the course, so we can see that there were indeed statistical methods taught. However, from the other courses you mentioned, I would actually recommend you to follow [REDACTED] with R, just for your own sake, so you have a bit more background knowledge to help you when you start in AI in Society (as, I suppose, maybe you did not study very technical subjects in an [REDACTED]’s?). That’s just a recommendation.\n  2.  How about you describe to me roughly what your project was about – I could then tell you if it sounds sufficient. 😊\n  3.  It technically does not matter when in this period you send your application. However, due to the big amount applications, this year we had to split up the aptitude test into multiple dates. Please don’t take “first come, first serve” as a solid rule here, but I would recommend submitting your application rather sooner than later.\nI hope I could help a bit!\nBest wishes\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nI recently noticed your Masters program titled ‘AI in Society’, and became very interested in applying as soon as the registration opens in 2025. A bit about me: I am now in the final year of my Bachelor program in [REDACTED] at the University of Malmö in Sweden. However, although it seems I will meet the program-requirements based on my current curriculum, I still have some questions. Could you help me answer whether:\n  1.  I meet the requirement of having 5 ECTS in mathematics/statistics passed if I successfully completed a 7.5 ECTS module on “Research and Methods”. Although the title does not specify the inclusion of statistics, a substantive part of this module focused on quantitative research methodology. If this is not deemed sufficient, would you be able to tell me whether (one of the) following courses does/does not meet this requirement (in case my current module is not sufficient, I would follow one of the following courses in order to meet the requirement):\n     *   [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] (7.5 ECTS)\n     *   [REDACTED] with R (7.5 ECTS)\n     *   [REDACTED] with R (4.5 ECTS)\n  1.  In relation to the 18 ECTS practical project, could you elaborate on what is meant with ’technical tools’ or ’similar’? See the following excerpt from the website page: \"They especially need to involve a practical aspect, e.g. you should have investigated or worked on a societal problem with technical tools, for example programming, statistical analysis, or similar.”. Would the use of any quantitative method during the project suffice for example? What if the project combines quantitative and qualitative methods?\n  2.  Does it matter during which period of the application opening (between February and May 31st) I apply for the program? For example, will everyone receive their admission result at the same time, and will the aptitude test be held on different dates?\nI hope you can help me answer these questions; I look forward to applying for the program!\nBest,\n[REDACTED]\n<AIS_MastersDays.pdf><study_doc_1.png><study_doc_2.png><study_doc_3.png>\n"}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

If during the meeting with the departmental student academic advisor (is that you?) it turns out that the conversion is very disadvantageous for me, can I still withdraw my application?\n  4.  If an application is approved and a course I have already passed is recognized and its grade is transferred, can I still take the equivalent course at TUM?\n  5.  And if so,\n     *   can I improve the grade of the already recognized achievement through the TUM course?\n     *   can I keep the grade of the recognized achievement in case I get a worse grade in the TUM course?\nThank you very much for your constant effort and support!\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nthis email is to inform you about the process regarding the recognition of credits.

Essentially, these are topics to help you study machine learning and data science, which will already be taught from the first semester onwards (see “Foundations of AI & [REDACTED]”). If there are possibilities for you to still study such courses at your university, I would take the chance.\nAs for the project: what you are describing might be a bit insufficient, regarding the technical aspect.

Ok \nAbout the project; the reason I asked about the specific quantitative requirements is because I intent on using my BA thesis as ‘proof’ of my practical project. The focus of my thesis is on the growing importance of industry-experts in global AI governance, and will involve both quantitative and qualitative methods. However, I will only be able to submit the thesis project for my application in May next year, hence the question about the best time(s) to apply for the program. Will everyone receive their admission results at the same time? Another option would be to submit my minor thesis (15 ECTS) which was a case-study (including quant. thematic analysis) on China’s growing role within the UN, supplemented by my work as an analyst where I’ve worked on a project focusing on the future challenges of Western democracy (e.g. the role of emerging technologies). However I don’t have any hard-proof of having used statistical methods). Maybe you can tell me what my best option is here.\nSorry for the long e-mail; I appreciate your response ik advance!\nBest,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nThank you for your interest in our study program. Of course, I’m happy to answer your questions:\n  1.  Your course “Research and Methods” would pass as sufficient, if you also provide us a description of what has been taught in the course, so we can see that there were indeed statistical methods taught. However, from the other courses you mentioned, I would actually recommend you to follow [REDACTED] with R, just for your own sake, so you have a bit more background knowledge to help you when you start in AI in Society (as, I suppose, maybe you did not study very technical subjects in an [REDACTED]’s?). That’s just a recommendation.\n  2.  How about you describe to me roughly what your project was about – I could then tell you if it sounds sufficient. 😊\n  3.  It technically does not matter when in this period you send your application. However, due to the big amount applications, this year we had to split up the aptitude test into multiple dates. Please don’t take “first come, first serve” as a solid rule here, but I would recommend submitting your application rather sooner than later.\nI hope I could help a bit!\nBest wishes\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nI recently noticed your Masters program titled ‘AI in Society’, and became very interested in applying as soon as the registration opens in 2025. A bit about me: I am now in the final year of my Bachelor program in [REDACTED] at the University of Malmö in Sweden. However, although it seems I will meet the program-requirements based on my current curriculum, I still have some questions. Could you help me answer whether:\n  1.  I meet the requirement of having 5 ECTS in mathematics/statistics passed if I successfully completed a 7.5 ECTS module on “Research and Methods”. Although the title does not specify the inclusion of statistics, a substantive part of this module focused on quantitative research methodology. If this is not deemed sufficient, would you be able to tell me whether (one of the) following courses does/does not meet this requirement (in case my current module is not sufficient, I would follow one of the following courses in order to meet the requirement):\n     *   [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] (7.5 ECTS)\n     *   [REDACTED] with R (7.5 ECTS)\n     *   [REDACTED] with R (4.5 ECTS)\n  1.  In relation to the 18 ECTS practical project, could you elaborate on what is meant with ’technical tools’ or ’similar’? See the following excerpt from the website page: \"They especially need to involve a practical aspect, e.g. you should have investigated or worked on a societal problem with technical tools, for example programming, statistical analysis, or similar.”. Would the use of any quantitative method during the project suffice for example? What if the project combines quantitative and qualitative methods?\n  2.

It's a good laugh but also very sad, a textbook example and real encountering of German bureaucracy.\nSilver lining is that one of the classmate shared a notary contact to me and the success story how he submitted his documents even they are just copies. As my university has sent me updated version of my transcript which looks more similar to the uploaded ones. I'm going to submit the document this on Thu/Fri directly to their office and see if it makes a difference. Another attested disclaimer directly from NCCU principle is on the way to Germany to serve as the last bulletproof measures if the lady again rejected the local notarized documents.\nAfter this local notarized copy being submitted, I'll write her a follow up email with a comparison of the online and paper form and notary proof pictures, to serve as a ground that no objection should be made. I hope this will help to dissolve the situation.\nThank you again! And hopefully I can get this passed by really soon to officially start my life here.\nBR,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nI have now heard back, and this is what she’s saying:\nThey are missing a notarized Transcript of Records which lists all of your modules and their grades (from [REDACTED] University). I don’t know how exactly the document looks like that they have from you currently, but apparently they can only see a summary of average grades for each semester. And this is what seems to be insufficient. She also said that there is no workaround around this, and no other document they would accept instead.\nDoes this make sense? Because I can only see the documents that you uploaded online, I don’t know what exactly they have received via physical mail. Maybe you can get in contact with her directly: [REDACTED]@zv.tum.d[IMAGE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]ailto:[REDACTED]@zv.tum.de> (her name is [REDACTED]).\nPlease feel free to keep me in CC. I’m very sorry that I still can’t give you another way out here. Maybe you can ask to speak to her on the phone, so you come to a solution quicker?\nAbout your encounter at the Center of Study and Learning you emailed me about earlier: I am super sorry to hear – this should not happen and is not our standard at TUM at all. I genuinely hope this was your last bad encounter with our university. Most probably the employees at the center were stressed due to high workload currently, but this is of course no reason to yell at anybody, I would like to apologize to you once again.\nPlease keep me in the loop with any news and if you’ve spoken to Mrs. Schmidberger. Unfortunately, I can only play the messenger here and don’t make any decisions, and the above is the response I received back.\nBest wishes and best of luck once again,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nHope you had a nice weekend!\nHave you heard back from the lady? What was the issue about my documents? 🥲\nI really think if there's any concern, they should at least name it so that I can work toward it.\nBR,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nThank you for your comforting words and assurance. This means a lot to me.\nThe immediate enrolment is also crucial for me as I want to sign up for German language class (was already due on Monday) and other project classes from the TUM management school, as well as finding a student work position outside. Without the enrollment and the status as a student, the above is not possible since I can't access the class system and am not officially recognized as a student within Germany. I also need this to check up scholarship opportunities. Not to mention entry to the building, library and eating at Mensa etc etc.\nI would appreciate to see the person come back to you with concrete concern and suggestion and we work to address it directly and asap.\nI actually had a humiliating experience last Wed when I went to the Center of Study and Learning (I currently live 4 hours away from Munich) and asked if they received my university transcript. After queuing for 40 mins, the lady insisted they don't have my document given I presented her UPS tracking result and signature. The lady then went to the back office and retrieved my document folder and asked me where is your transcript VERY LOUD. I showed the proof of the signature and she again SHOUTED to me in front of the crowds that she doesn't know where it is, it's not in their office yet \"WHERE IS YOUR TRANSCRIPT?\". I later found the TUM mailroom and confirmed with the person who signed the signature, he showed me the TUM mailing system and confirmed they had already received it on 1st of Oct, yet the Center of Study and Learning didn't admit whether they lost it or it's still in the pile. I was really desperate since that transcript is the only one I have on hand. And now after almost another week and me following up by email and many calls, they convey through a 3rd person saying my transcript is not sufficient without giving a concrete answer.\nHonestly I think this whole matriculation process with TUM has logical, resource allocation and operational issues. And it needs to be addressed to the school level. As I said, I have been through background checking many many times from INSEAD, Intel, Infineon, Microsoft and all of them had never had an issue with my documents. This can easily be escalated to law or PR issues if one of the students/candidates decided to go public for this frustrating experience.\nThank you.\nBR,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nI’m very sorry that the situation turned out to be so complicated and you have to deal with all of this, when you should have been able to start your studies without all of these worries. I totally understand your frustration at this point.\nI have contacted a person at the matriculation office directly about your case a few days ago, if she could help me to clarify what exactly is missing in your case. I’m still waiting for a response, but I should hear back any day now.\nI’ll suggest the following to you: I will ask if the solution you proposed to me just now would work for them. If yes, we will issue this statement ASAP, no problem. If no, I will find out what other solution they propose. I feel like there is some misunderstanding, since the documents you submitted for the application in the first place were marked as sufficient.\nLong story short: I’ll try my best to resolve your problem with my colleagues at the matriculation office directly and as soon as possible. Please don’t worry, we will get this problem resolved.\nWhile you are not matriculated, you can of course still attend your courses as normal. Please just make sure to connect with your classmates, so they can help you obtain the lecture materials while you do not have access to them online (due to not being enrolled officially). The course registrations are open until mid-November. Until then your matriculation issue should be resolved, and you’ll be able to register for the courses officially.\nAgain, I’d like to apologize to you on behalf of the university here. This is not how it’s supposed to go – please rest assured that we will get this resolved.\nIf you have more questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out to me.\nHave a nice day and best wishes\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nI apologize for continuing to include you in this email thread, but the situation has become increasingly complex. As of now, the TUM Center for Study and Learning is still unable to explain why they are not allowing my enrollment, despite my submission of all required notarized documents on October 1st, which were based on my undergraduate degree and transcripts.\nThere's one issue where I may need your assistance. During the application process, I also submitted my INSEAD MBA degree and transcripts, although this is not a prerequisite for the TUM AI and Society master's program. I submitted all my degree documents without realizing I might need to have them all notarized. As a non-French citizen, it's extremely complicated to obtain notarized documents from an English-teaching school in France that meet German official requirements. If the ZAB (Statement of Comparability, Zeugnisbewertung) is not accepted by the TUM Center for Study and Learning, I will be left without a solution. Today, I contacted all relevant embassies (Taiwanese, French, and German) in Munich and Paris, but none could offer a solution to notarize an English-taught French school graduation certificate and transcripts.\nI would like to inquire if you could help me obtain proof from the original AIS admission committee stating that my study place/admission was not contingent on my MBA degree. If we can present this document to the TUM Center for Study and Learning, it might facilitate my enrollment without further issues, as they are primarily concerned with verifying the documents on which my admission was based.\nBR,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nI hope you had a great weekend.\nAfter several attempts trying to contact Student information in person and via phone calls, I have received confirmation that you have received my transcript but you still have questions regarding the document of my transcript. Here's the message I received from the system:\n01.10.24 still not the Transcript of records submitted, confirmation of semester grades are not sufficient. Please submit a certified copy of your transcript of records which you have uploaded for the admission 30.09.24 We still need your Transcript of Records. We have only received confirmation that you have graduated and no overall grade has been given.\nCan you please specify why the transcript was not accepted given it's the official and latest (Sep 2024) document from [REDACTED] University from Taiwan? And what solution do you recommend for me to have this issue addressed? I have also attached ZAB from Germany certified my degrees are correct and accepted by Germany official institutions (as attached).\nTo give you a few explanations that you might have questions regarding my transcript:\n1. Version and format difference: I graduated in 2009, the digital version I uploaded was a transcript I got from my university in 2017. And since TUM required a paper version for matriculation, I have applied for a new one this year 2024 when I was in Taiwan earlier. There's a major change in how the paper texture, layout, format looks and that's why the digital and paper documents look very different.\n2. Last semester taken abroad: I studied my last semester as an exchange student abroad, and the 2024 transcript version my university decided to change how it looks to show \"grade not shown\" as they don't accept foreign grades. It didn't impact my graduation requirement as I already fulfilled all the requirements before heading out for exchange and thus I still got my certificate of graduation in the same year.\n3. I have already graduated from my undergraduate degree in 2009, worked for more than 10 years including Intel, Infineon and Microsoft as a full time employee and also got an INSEAD MBA in 2020. All of my later experiences had done the same for my university degree checking, some even went further to hire a 3rd party organization checking the authenticity of my degrees and I'd never encountered someone saying my transcript had an issue. Would you please tell me how you view my transcript different from what you need and what you propose to address it?\nThank you.\nBR,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED] information,\nI hope you are doing well. I have received an attached message saying you couldn't find the transcript proof and hence still delayed my enrollment. Please note:\n1. UPS tracking # 1Z8EG44TDK[NUMBER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]<[URLREDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] (received and signed by abdallah on 1st of Oct, 2024)\nThis document is the transcript document issued from my university in Sep, 2024 as the official proof of my grades qualified graduation and hence I've already got my undergraduate degree back in 2009.\n2. The transcript document which I used to apply for AIS TUM was a document I got from 2017. For the reason TUM required a notary and stamped document, I went to my university this September and got an official copy, they have updated the format of the transcript as well as the paper used and that's why it looks slightly different from the one I uploaded during my application process.\n3. I'm also attaching a certificate from Zentralstelle für ausländisches Bildungswesen which authenticated my educational background including my undergraduate from an official institute inside Germany.\nPlease proceed with my enrollment as soon as possible as this is impeding my rights to start my semester after tackling so many tasks to come this far.\nBR,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nHi TUM student information,\nCan you please help me to check my case?

I don’t know how exactly the document looks like that they have from you currently, but apparently they can only see a summary of average grades for each semester. And this is what seems to be insufficient. She also said that there is no workaround around this, and no other document they would accept instead.\nDoes this make sense? Because I can only see the documents that you uploaded online, I don’t know what exactly they have received via physical mail. Maybe you can get in contact with her directly: [REDACTED]@zv.tum.d[IMAGE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]ailto:[REDACTED]@zv.tum.de> (her name is [REDACTED]).\nPlease feel free to keep me in CC. I’m very sorry that I still can’t give you another way out here. Maybe you can ask to speak to her on the phone, so you come to a solution quicker?\nAbout your encounter at the Center of Study and Learning you emailed me about earlier: I am super sorry to hear – this should not happen and is not our standard at TUM at all. I genuinely hope this was your last bad encounter with our university. Most probably the employees at the center were stressed due to high workload currently, but this is of course no reason to yell at anybody, I would like to apologize to you once again.\nPlease keep me in the loop with any news and if you’ve spoken to Mrs. Schmidberger. Unfortunately, I can only play the messenger here and don’t make any decisions, and the above is the response I received back.\nBest wishes and best of luck once again,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nHope you had a nice weekend!\nHave you heard back from the lady? What was the issue about my documents? 🥲\nI really think if there's any concern, they should at least name it so that I can work toward it.\nBR,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nThank you for your comforting words and assurance. This means a lot to me.\nThe immediate enrolment is also crucial for me as I want to sign up for German language class (was already due on Monday) and other project classes from the TUM management school, as well as finding a student work position outside. Without the enrollment and the status as a student, the above is not possible since I can't access the class system and am not officially recognized as a student within Germany. I also need this to check up scholarship opportunities. Not to mention entry to the building, library and eating at Mensa etc etc.\nI would appreciate to see the person come back to you with concrete concern and suggestion and we work to address it directly and asap.\nI actually had a humiliating experience last Wed when I went to the Center of Study and Learning (I currently live 4 hours away from Munich) and asked if they received my university transcript. After queuing for 40 mins, the lady insisted they don't have my document given I presented her UPS tracking result and signature. The lady then went to the back office and retrieved my document folder and asked me where is your transcript VERY LOUD. I showed the proof of the signature and she again SHOUTED to me in front of the crowds that she doesn't know where it is, it's not in their office yet \"WHERE IS YOUR TRANSCRIPT?\". I later found the TUM mailroom and confirmed with the person who signed the signature, he showed me the TUM mailing system and confirmed they had already received it on 1st of Oct, yet the Center of Study and Learning didn't admit whether they lost it or it's still in the pile. I was really desperate since that transcript is the only one I have on hand. And now after almost another week and me following up by email and many calls, they convey through a 3rd person saying my transcript is not sufficient without giving a concrete answer.\nHonestly I think this whole matriculation process with TUM has logical, resource allocation and operational issues. And it needs to be addressed to the school level. As I said, I have been through background checking many many times from INSEAD, Intel, Infineon, Microsoft and all of them had never had an issue with my documents. This can easily be escalated to law or PR issues if one of the students/candidates decided to go public for this frustrating experience.\nThank you.\nBR,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nI’m very sorry that the situation turned out to be so complicated and you have to deal with all of this, when you should have been able to start your studies without all of these worries. I totally understand your frustration at this point.\nI have contacted a person at the matriculation office directly about your case a few days ago, if she could help me to clarify what exactly is missing in your case. I’m still waiting for a response, but I should hear back any day now.\nI’ll suggest the following to you: I will ask if the solution you proposed to me just now would work for them. If yes, we will issue this statement ASAP, no problem. If no, I will find out what other solution they propose. I feel like there is some misunderstanding, since the documents you submitted for the application in the first place were marked as sufficient.\nLong story short: I’ll try my best to resolve your problem with my colleagues at the matriculation office directly and as soon as possible. Please don’t worry, we will get this problem resolved.\nWhile you are not matriculated, you can of course still attend your courses as normal. Please just make sure to connect with your classmates, so they can help you obtain the lecture materials while you do not have access to them online (due to not being enrolled officially). The course registrations are open until mid-November. Until then your matriculation issue should be resolved, and you’ll be able to register for the courses officially.\nAgain, I’d like to apologize to you on behalf of the university here. This is not how it’s supposed to go – please rest assured that we will get this resolved.\nIf you have more questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out to me.\nHave a nice day and best wishes\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED]. [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nI apologize for continuing to include you in this email thread, but the situation has become increasingly complex. As of now, the TUM Center for Study and Learning is still unable to explain why they are not allowing my enrollment, despite my submission of all required notarized documents on October 1st, which were based on my undergraduate degree and transcripts.\nThere's one issue where I may need your assistance. During the application process, I also submitted my INSEAD MBA degree and transcripts, although this is not a prerequisite for the TUM AI and Society master's program. I submitted all my degree documents without realizing I might need to have them all notarized. As a non-French citizen, it's extremely complicated to obtain notarized documents from an English-teaching school in France that meet German official requirements. If the ZAB (Statement of Comparability, Zeugnisbewertung) is not accepted by the TUM Center for Study and Learning, I will be left without a solution. Today, I contacted all relevant embassies (Taiwanese, French, and German) in Munich and Paris, but none could offer a solution to notarize an English-taught French school graduation certificate and transcripts.\nI would like to inquire if you could help me obtain proof from the original AIS admission committee stating that my study place/admission was not contingent on my MBA degree. If we can present this document to the TUM Center for Study and Learning, it might facilitate my enrollment without further issues, as they are primarily concerned with verifying the documents on which my admission was based.\nBR,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nI hope you had a great weekend.\nAfter several attempts trying to contact Student information in person and via phone calls, I have received confirmation that you have received my transcript but you still have questions regarding the document of my transcript. Here's the message I received from the system:\n01.10.24 still not the Transcript of records submitted, confirmation of semester grades are not sufficient. Please submit a certified copy of your transcript of records which you have uploaded for the admission 30.09.24 We still need your Transcript of Records. We have only received confirmation that you have graduated and no overall grade has been given.\nCan you please specify why the transcript was not accepted given it's the official and latest (Sep 2024) document from [REDACTED] University from Taiwan? And what solution do you recommend for me to have this issue addressed? I have also attached ZAB from Germany certified my degrees are correct and accepted by Germany official institutions (as attached).\nTo give you a few explanations that you might have questions regarding my transcript:\n1. Version and format difference: I graduated in 2009, the digital version I uploaded was a transcript I got from my university in 2017. And since TUM required a paper version for matriculation, I have applied for a new one this year 2024 when I was in Taiwan earlier. There's a major change in how the paper texture, layout, format looks and that's why the digital and paper documents look very different.\n2. Last semester taken abroad: I studied my last semester as an exchange student abroad, and the 2024 transcript version my university decided to change how it looks to show \"grade not shown\" as they don't accept foreign grades. It didn't impact my graduation requirement as I already fulfilled all the requirements before heading out for exchange and thus I still got my certificate of graduation in the same year.\n3. I have already graduated from my undergraduate degree in 2009, worked for more than 10 years including Intel, Infineon and Microsoft as a full time employee and also got an INSEAD MBA in 2020. All of my later experiences had done the same for my university degree checking, some even went further to hire a 3rd party organization checking the authenticity of my degrees and I'd never encountered someone saying my transcript had an issue. Would you please tell me how you view my transcript different from what you need and what you propose to address it?\nThank you.\nBR,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED] information,\nI hope you are doing well. I have received an attached message saying you couldn't find the transcript proof and hence still delayed my enrollment. Please note:\n1. UPS tracking # 1Z8EG44TDK[NUMBER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]<[URLREDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY] (received and signed by abdallah on 1st of Oct, 2024)\nThis document is the transcript document issued from my university in Sep, 2024 as the official proof of my grades qualified graduation and hence I've already got my undergraduate degree back in 2009.\n2. The transcript document which I used to apply for AIS TUM was a document I got from 2017. For the reason TUM required a notary and stamped document, I went to my university this September and got an official copy, they have updated the format of the transcript as well as the paper used and that's why it looks slightly different from the one I uploaded during my application process.\n3. I'm also attaching a certificate from Zentralstelle für ausländisches Bildungswesen which authenticated my educational background including my undergraduate from an official institute inside Germany.\nPlease proceed with my enrollment as soon as possible as this is impeding my rights to start my semester after tackling so many tasks to come this far.\nBR,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nHi TUM student information,\nCan you please help me to check my case?

Die arme hat schon alles mögliche gemacht (4h nach München zum CST gefahren, wo ihr niemand was sagen konnte, bei Botschaften angefragt ob sie ihr Transkript beglaubigen können, herumtelefoniert und Mails geschrieben…) – es würde mich wirklich freuen, wenn wir ihr schnellstmöglich helfen könnten.\nKönntest du mir erklären, was genau mit ihren Dokumenten nicht stimmt?

Here's the message I received from the system:\n01.10.24 still not the Transcript of records submitted, confirmation of semester grades are not sufficient. Please submit a certified copy of your transcript of records which you have uploaded for the admission 30.09.24 We still need your Transcript of Records. We have only received confirmation that you have graduated and no overall grade has been given.\nCan you please specify why the transcript was not accepted given it's the official and latest (Sep 2024) document from [REDACTED] University from Taiwan? And what solution do you recommend for me to have this issue addressed? I have also attached ZAB from Germany certified my degrees are correct and accepted by Germany official institutions (as attached).\nTo give you a few explanations that you might have questions regarding my transcript:\n1. Version and format difference: I graduated in 2009, the digital version I uploaded was a transcript I got from my university in 2017. And since TUM required a paper version for matriculation, I have applied for a new one this year 2024 when I was in Taiwan earlier. There's a major change in how the paper texture, layout, format looks and that's why the digital and paper documents look very different.\n2. Last semester taken abroad: I studied my last semester as an exchange student abroad, and the 2024 transcript version my university decided to change how it looks to show \"grade not shown\" as they don't accept foreign grades. It didn't impact my graduation requirement as I already fulfilled all the requirements before heading out for exchange and thus I still got my certificate of graduation in the same year.\n3. I have already graduated from my undergraduate degree in 2009, worked for more than 10 years including Intel, Infineon and Microsoft as a full time employee and also got an INSEAD MBA in 2020. All of my later experiences had done the same for my university degree checking, some even went further to hire a 3rd party organization checking the authenticity of my degrees and I'd never encountered someone saying my transcript had an issue. Would you please tell me how you view my transcript different from what you need and what you propose to address it?\nThank you.\nBR,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED] information,\nI hope you are doing well. I have received an attached message saying you couldn't find the transcript proof and hence still delayed my enrollment. Please note:\n1.

The transcript document which I used to apply for AIS TUM was a document I got from 2017. For the reason TUM required a notary and stamped document, I went to my university this September and got an official copy, they have updated the format of the transcript as well as the paper used and that's why it looks slightly different from the one I uploaded during my application process.\n3. I'm also attaching a certificate from Zentralstelle für ausländisches Bildungswesen which authenticated my educational background including my undergraduate from an official institute inside Germany.\nPlease proceed with my enrollment as soon as possible as this is impeding my rights to start my semester after tackling so many tasks to come this far.\nBR,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nHi TUM student information,\nCan you please help me to check my case?

I submitted all my degree documents without realizing I might need to have them all notarized. As a non-French citizen, it's extremely complicated to obtain notarized documents from an English-teaching school in France that meet German official requirements. If the ZAB (Statement of Comparability, Zeugnisbewertung) is not accepted by the TUM Center for Study and Learning, I will be left without a solution. Today, I contacted all relevant embassies (Taiwanese, French, and German) in Munich and Paris, but none could offer a solution to notarize an English-taught French school graduation certificate and transcripts.\nI would like to inquire if you could help me obtain proof from the original AIS admission committee stating that my study place/admission was not contingent on my MBA degree. If we can present this document to the TUM Center for Study and Learning, it might facilitate my enrollment without further issues, as they are primarily concerned with verifying the documents on which my admission was based.\nBR,\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nI hope you had a great weekend.\nAfter several attempts trying to contact Student information in person and via phone calls, I have received confirmation that you have received my transcript but you still have questions regarding the document of my transcript. Here's the message I received from the system:\n01.10.24 still not the Transcript of records submitted, confirmation of semester grades are not sufficient. Please submit a certified copy of your transcript of records which you have uploaded for the admission 30.09.24 We still need your Transcript of Records. We have only received confirmation that you have graduated and no overall grade has been given.\nCan you please specify why the transcript was not accepted given it's the official and latest (Sep 2024) document from [REDACTED] University from Taiwan? And what solution do you recommend for me to have this issue addressed? I have also attached ZAB from Germany certified my degrees are correct and accepted by Germany official institutions (as attached).\nTo give you a few explanations that you might have questions regarding my transcript:\n1. Version and format difference: I graduated in 2009, the digital version I uploaded was a transcript I got from my university in 2017. And since TUM required a paper version for matriculation, I have applied for a new one this year 2024 when I was in Taiwan earlier. There's a major change in how the paper texture, layout, format looks and that's why the digital and paper documents look very different.\n2. Last semester taken abroad: I studied my last semester as an exchange student abroad, and the 2024 transcript version my university decided to change how it looks to show \"grade not shown\" as they don't accept foreign grades. It didn't impact my graduation requirement as I already fulfilled all the requirements before heading out for exchange and thus I still got my certificate of graduation in the same year.\n3. I have already graduated from my undergraduate degree in 2009, worked for more than 10 years including Intel, Infineon and Microsoft as a full time employee and also got an INSEAD MBA in 2020. All of my later experiences had done the same for my university degree checking, some even went further to hire a 3rd party organization checking the authenticity of my degrees and I'd never encountered someone saying my transcript had an issue. Would you please tell me how you view my transcript different from what you need and what you propose to address it?\nThank you.\nBR,\n[REDACTED]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED] information,\nI hope you are doing well.

We recommend you do so before the semester begins.\nTo complete your enrollment, you must:\n•       officially accept our offer of admission in TUMonline,\n•       transfer the semester fee by the deadline, and\n•       submit any missing documents, including the signed enrollment application, to the Admissions and [REDACTED] (Immatrikulationsamt) within the designated timeframe, i.e. your documents must be stamped received by TUM by the deadline.\nAfter you have accepted your offer of admission, or “study place” in TUMonline, you need to provide any missing information in your account. Go to the “Enrollment” tab and click on the button “Add data”.\nFill out the form for adding any missing information and upload any required documents that have not yet been submitted. If you do not have the necessary documents at this time, you can upload them at a later date. For now, you can skip the upload step by clicking on the “Continue” button to end this step.\nOnce you click “Continue”, the link to the application for enrollment will be activated. (If you are not able to access the enrollment application, it means you have not completed the step above. Return to the “Add data” mask and click “Continue”.) You will also be given a list of all documents required for enrollment.\nSome documents (e.g. passport-style photo or proof of health insurance) can be directly uploaded in TUMonline. Others must be sent in hardcopy by mail (e.g. the signed enrollment application, official transcripts and diplomas). The list will indicate which documents require certification.\nYou will need to print the enrollment application and send it as a signed hardcopy, together with any documents relevant for enrollment, by mail to TUM.\nOnce you have completed the above requirements, you will be enrolled automatically. You do not need to appear in person to enroll.\nYou will find detailed instructions on completing the enrollment process at: https://www.tum.de/studium/bewerbung/immatrikulation/\nYou will find all relevant deadlines at: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/application/application-info-portal/dates-periods-and-deadlines/\nThank you!\nYour TUM Center for Study and Teaching\nTechnical University of Munich\nPlease note, the English-language version of the letter of admission is for reference purposes only. [REDACTED]-language document alone is legally binding. Should you require a legally-binding copy of your letter of admission in English, you must consult a sworn (court registered) translator in your country.\n"}], "max_tokens": 2000}}
