AI in Society at TUM on the 16th of July 2024. We have assessed your application and test scores, and as a result would like to invite you to the second stage of the aptitude assessment in the form of an interview.\nDuring the aptitude interview, two members of the selection committee will discuss your motivation for choosing this degree program. They will also explore your willingness to engage in interdisciplinary learning and work, your professional interests, any previous specializations, and your professional background to assess how well these align with the goals of the program and your career aspirations. We will focus on understanding your motivation for the study program, not testing your knowledge on specific subjects.\nThe interviews will take place from July 22nd to July 30th and will be conducted online over Zoom.\nHow to select a timeslot:\nPlease use the following link: https://app.kulibri.com/pr/wDNpoAroZL4b/1BWn1BWnmarZw9zE\nYou will need to enter your email address as well as your full name. Please then choose one timeslot that works best for you. Try to refrain from selecting multiple timeslots, as they are limited. Each timeslot can only be selected by one person, therefore the distribution of slots works by the principle “first come, first serve”. Don’t forget to submit your answer after selecting.\nShould you want to change your selection later, you will be able to do so yourself. However, please shortly let us know in case you had to change your slot (especially last minute).\nAs soon as you have selected a time slot, you can think of it as confirmed – there will be no additional email confirming your timeslot. You will receive your personal Zoom link at least 12 hours in advance to your interview. Before the conversation, please make sure everything works from your end (camera, microphone, internet connection).\nIf you have any questions about the procedure, please reach out to [REDACTED]@sot.tum.de<mailto:[REDACTED]@sot.tum.de>\nWe are looking forward to getting to know to you better!\n---\n[REDACTED]\nPhD Candidate\nCoordination TUM Master AI in Society\n[REDACTED]\nTUM School of [REDACTED] and Technology\nhttps://www.gov.sot.tum.de/rds"}], "temperature": 0.2, "max_tokens": 2000}}

The majority of the subjects will be held in the city center. Specifically, you will have your lectures in Richard-Wagner-Str.1, Marsstr. 20-22, and Arcisstr. 21.\n  2.  The lecture type modules usually end with a final exam making up the entire grade. Some lectures (like Foundations of AI & [REDACTED]) also have an accompanying exercise with assignments, which can give bonus points to the final exam. In the seminar type modules, the examination can consist of a presentation, a small group project, or similar. This depends on the final decision of the lecturer.\n  3.  Our program does not include internships in a fixed manner, i.e. they are not explicitly integrated into the study program and are not mandatory. However, you are of course welcome to complete an internship regardless during your studies, which is also highly recommended. Many students also work part-time in companies as so called “Werkstudent”. You might want to look into this, by searching up companies that interest you and looking for such Werkstudent vacancies.\n  4.  No, this will not be a problem. You will be able to follow the content online, as the lectures will be streamed in parallel (e.g. via Zoom).\n  5.  German language is not required for our Master’s program, as all modules are taught in English. But, of course, some knowledge of German will make life here easier for you. Please feel free to check out TUM’s language center: https://www.sprachenzentrum.tum.de/en/sz/homepage/\nBest wishes\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nThank you for your response. I would greatly appreciate your help in clarifying a few more questions:\n1. [REDACTED]: Could you please confirm on which campus all my subjects will be held? I'm looking to find accommodation as close to the campus as possible to minimize commuting time.\n2. [REDACTED]: Could you provide details on the evaluation system for each subject? For example, will there be a combination of assignments, projects, and a final exam? Additionally, what percentage of the final grade will be based on the final exam?.\n3. [REDACTED]: Does the master’s program include internships to gain practical work experience in Germany? If so, when would these internships typically take place?.\n4. [REDACTED]: I will need to travel to my home country from December 10th to 20th aprox. Would it be possible to attend classes online during this period without negatively affecting my performance?.\n5. [REDACTED]: How relevant is proficiency in German for succeeding in the Master’s program and securing job opportunities related to the field? Also, does TUM offer German language courses as an extracurricular option included in the Master's program fees?\nThank you again for your assistance.\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nI think it will be no problem if you attend the courses online until end of October.\nRegarding your questions: could you please collect them in an email for me? I will be out of office most of the time for the rest of August, but I will get back to your questions as fast as I can during this time.\nThank you and best wishes\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\nGood afternoon, [NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nI have already booked the appointment for my visa in my country for September 4th. I read that the visa must be affixed to my passport, so I will need to wait in Chile until it is ready. The processing time is 6-8 weeks, so in the worst-case scenario, I might receive the visa by October 30th. Could I attend my course online until then?\nFinally, I have some questions that I need your help with please. I have a meeting today with a student advisor, but she mentioned that many of my questions should be addressed by you since this is a new master's program.\nIs it possible to book a 15-minute Zoom meeting with you?\n\nEl mar, 6 ago 2024 a las 22:56, Fabián Campos (<[REDACTED]@gmail.co[IMAGE_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]ailto:[REDACTED]@gmail.com>>) escribió:\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY],\nThank you so much. It's a great solution you're suggesting because I wouldn't want to wait a year to start. Is it possible that once I apply for the study visa in my country, I can travel to Munich immediately on a tourist visa (up to 3 months), while waiting for my study visa? This way, I can attend classes in person.\n\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nI’m sorry to hear! Unfortunately, you cannot officially start in a summer semester. You could only defer it to next winter semester (if you have not yet accepted the offer online).\nHowever, for the time being (while you are not yet in Munich), you can participate in the courses online. We will make sure they will all be streamed in parallel for people who could not make it here physically in time.\nDoes this work for you?\nBest wishes\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n---\n[NAME_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[HEADER_REDACTED_AUTOMATICALLY]\n[REDACTED],\nI hope this message finds you well. I have recently been informed that the processing time for a student visa takes 6-8 weeks, and the earliest available appointment in my country of residence, Chile, is on August 28th. This timeline means that I will not receive my visa in time to travel to Munich for the start of the October semester.\nI am deeply disappointed by this situation as I was very much looking forward to starting my studies in October. Given the challenges involved in reapplying and the risk associated with it, I am seeking an alternative solution. Since I received my acceptance only a few days ago and am eager to join the program, could you please advise if it would be possible to defer my start date to the next summer semester?\nThank you very much for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your response.\n"}], "temperature": 0.2, "max_tokens": 2000}}

AI in Society at TUM,\nwe are currently receiving many inquiries from people who have not yet received an invitation to the aptitude test tomorrow. We apologize for the confusion - the reason is the following:\nwe received a large number of applications, which we unfortunetely didn't manage to check in time for the test date on June 26th (tomorrow). Therefore, we have a group of people who did not receive any feedback from us yet.\nWe will proceed the following way: there will be a second test date on July 16th, from 10:45 - 12:15 CEST. Should you be one of the applicants who did not yet hear back from us (and were not declined either), please await further feedback regarding your application in the coming weeks from us. We will finish checking the remaining applicants and invite you to the second test, should all your documents suffice. You do not need to worry about the exam tomorrow.\nIf you already received an invitation to the test tomorrow, please ignore this email. For you, the test is still being held tomorrow.\nWe apologize for the confusion this might have caused and hope for your understanding.\nBest wishes,\n[REDACTED]"}], "temperature": 0.2, "max_tokens": 2000}}
